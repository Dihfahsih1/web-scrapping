[{'Title': 'Are Psychiatric Patients Languishing in Your Emergency Department?', 'Description': 'Discover Proactive Solutions, with Measurable Results, to Managing the Influx of Psychiatric Patients. \nWhite Paper\nPrepared by Horizon Health Behavioral Health Services\nDownload White Paper\n\nThe Emergency Room Dilemma\nAs community mental health services and psychiatric hospital beds are reduced or eliminated, patients with critical psychiatric needs are swamping emergency rooms. This influx of psychiatric patients has created a community healthcare crisis, and alarm is intensifying among healthcare professionals and hospital administrators throughout the country.\nPsychiatric patients sometimes linger for days in emergency rooms while increasing the risk of harm to themselves, other patients, and staff; stretching resources at the expense of sacrificing quality care. Options appear limited as staff express fear of being harmed and frustration mounts as the struggle with how to best address the patients’ needs and discharge to suitable care intensifies. Prolonged boarding times can lead to overcrowding, compromise the care for all patients, and perpetuate intolerance from normally compassionate and caring hospital staff.\nAre you experiencing these issues with psychiatric patients in your emergency room?\n\nExtended lengths of stay\nAggression and violence\nDisruption of the overall milieu\nFrequent re-admissions\nLimited financial resources and community/family support\n\nAre your staff facing some of these common concerns as they find themselves confronted with psychiatric patients?\n\nInjury, or fear of injury\nThreats and intimidation\nFeeling stressed and fatigued\nLack of effective risk assessment\nFrustrated treatment teams and inconsistent responses\nInsufficient training in anger de-escalation and aggression prevention\n\nQuestions are building as hospital administrators and healthcare professionals grapple to find solutions. Recognizing that services in the community won’t just materialize, answers appear elusive at best.\nThe adverse consequences of a hospital not being able to effectively manage psychiatric patients in their emergency department are staggering and far-reaching. The problems they are facing today will only grow more acute, and absent a cohesive plan, place the hospital in a very precarious situation.\nThe Horizon Relief Plan\nWith years of experience assisting and operating behavioral health programs within acute care hospitals all over the country, Horizon Health has learned what works and what doesn’t. Evidence has shown that through careful and targeted assessment, planning, training, and organizing, you can have direction and relief in your emergency room.\nPsychiatric patients come to your emergency room with critical emergent needs. These needs are often expressed through co-morbid behaviors such as anger, aggression, anxiety, psychosis, and depression, or medical issues and somatic complaints. The primary objective of the emergency room is to stabilize the immediate crisis and transfer the patient to the most appropriate and available care. This sounds simple enough, but practical application requires innovation, direction, and strategic implementation.\nHorizon begins by facilitating a thorough assessment of your concerns, facility, community resources, staffing patterns, training, policies, protocols, assessment process, and treatment regimens. We work with you to discover solutions specific to your organization. Horizon will provide direction, strategies and solutions needed to best equip your staff to:\n\nImplement formal initial and ongoing risk assessments\nEstablish treatment protocols\nDe-escalate potentially dangerous patients and situations\nSecure a safer environment\nImprove overall patient care\nReduce lengths of stay\n\nFor example, Horizon’s SECURETM crisis prevention training program provides staff with the necessary tools to assess problems and intervene effectively, while preserving patients’ safety, rights and dignity.\n\nAbout Horizon Health\nAs a leading behavioral services management company, we partner with hospitals seeking to optimize the delivery of behavioral health services. We bring our clinical, operational, and financial expertise to implement behavioral health programs that result in patient improvement and satisfaction. If you are interested in learning high-quality ways to launch a new behavioral health program or how to improve your existing one, contact us today to start your facility assessment.\n\n'}, {'Title': 'Addressing the Unmet Needs of an Aging Population', 'Description': 'Is an Inpatient Geropsychiatric Program Right for Your Hospital? \nWhite Paper\nPrepared by Horizon Health Behavioral Health Services\nDownload White Paper\n\nIs Your Hospital Meeting the Mental Health Needs of the Geriatric Population in Your Service Area?\n\nAre you currently treating geropsychiatric patients in medical/surgical beds?\nCan your hospital benefit from establishing a geropsychiatric program that meets the needs of the community, and produces additional revenue for your facility?\n\nHealthcare facilities typically offer very little in the way of geriatric psychiatric services. Too often, care takes a “one-size-fits-all” format where an adult psychiatric unit is thought to be adequate to provide services for all adults. Typically, because older patients often have concomitant medical issues, they are admitted to a medical/surgical unit where they receive treatment in a system where reimbursement is made based on the diagnosis code, not the number of days necessary for treatment. If geriatric patients are treated in a geropsychiatric unit, their treatment would be reimbursed on a per diem basis. The result: a more positive clinical outcome for the patient, and a more positive financial outcome for the hospital.\nWhy can’t these patients be treated on an adult psychiatric unit with the other adults? A secure, geropsychiatric unit, designed to address the unique physical and emotional needs of adults over age 65 with mental health issues, is not the same as an adult psychiatric unit. In addition, the clinical programming required for a geropsychiatric unit is markedly different than the programming required for younger adults.\nUnfortunately, when hospitals assess the need for an inpatient geropsychiatric program, they may overlook two key areas. First, they do not appreciate that these programs, if marketed properly, can develop into regional treatment centers of excellence. The second, and more common oversight, is to not move forward because one or more of their competitors has an existing inpatient psychiatric program. The irony is that the existence of these programs may be a compelling reason to introduce a geropsychiatric program.\nThe Mental Health Needs of an Aging Population\nRetirement is usually regarded as a positive, relaxing experience, but for some it can be the source of a great deal of worry and confusion about the future. Death of a loved one, debilitating injury or illness, and loss of independence can affect physical, mental, and emotional well-being. “Depression, one of the conditions most commonly associated with suicide in older adults, is a widely under-recognized and under-treated medical illness. Studies show that up to 75% of older adults who die by suicide visited a physician within a month before death.”1\nThe Geriatric Population\n\n“Persons 65 years and older numbered 39.6 million in 2009, and are expected to grow to be 19% of the population by 2030.”2\n“Six and a half million Americans aged 65 years or older are affected by depression. “3\n“As many as one half of all older people living in nursing homes have depression.”4\n“Disability due to mental illness in individuals over 65 years old will become a major public health problem in the near future because of demographic changes.”5\n\nIs a Geropsychiatric Program Right for Your Hospital?\nToday’s healthcare environment is complex and challenging, especially when it comes to understanding the potential need for a geropsychiatric unit in your hospital. Before you make a decision on this ques\xadtion, consider enlisting the assistance of a behavioral health services company that can help you make informed decisions.\n\nWhat are the demographics of the populations in your primary and secondary service areas?\nHow will you develop your referral base for a geropsychiatric unit which will differ from the referral base for your medical/surgical units?\nHow will you staff a geropsychiatric unit, and who will train the new staff?\nHow will you establish a geropsychiatric unit that meets your clinical and financial goals?\nHow will you benchmark clinical improvement for your treatment program?\n\n\nThe Horizon Solution\nA behavioral health contract management organization is a great resource in the process of establishing a geropsychiatric program that is viable and responsive to the changing needs of today. Horizon Health Behavioral Health Services is a psychiatric contract management organization with a demonstrated rec\xadord of assisting hospitals to develop inpatient geropsychiatric units.

Over the past several years we have witnessed a gradual increase of suicidal patients seeking care in hospital emergency departments (ED). In many situations, the staff caring for these patients is not adequately prepared to address the multi-dimensional issues that contribute to the patient’s dire situation. This trend, unfortunately, is not expected to dissipate in the foreseeable future. The ED has become the stop-gap plan for behavioral health crises due to shrinking community resources and lack of psychiatric services and beds. The reality is, that for every person who completes a suicide, more than 30 others attempt suicide, and thus present extraordinary clinical challenges for ED staff.\nThe Joint Commission’s 2014 National Patient Safety Goal 15.01.01 mandates that hospitals identify patients at risk for suicide. This requires an assessment process that identifies patients at risk, and recognizes environmental factors that may affect the patient’s risk level for suicide. There is also a requirement to immediately address the safety needs of the patient, including the patient’s safety during their stay in the ED. Hospitals are required to provide suicide prevention information to each patient and their family member(s) when a patient that is potentially at risk for suicide is discharged. To meet these requirements, hospitals must take a comprehensive and thorough approach to managing the suicidal patient in the ED, and identify and develop an appropriate discharge disposition. If you would like to evaluate your ED’s level ofreadiness to handle these patients, consider the following questions:\nDoes your ED have a comprehensive approach to meet the needs of the suicidal patient and their families? For instance, \n\nIs your suicide risk assessment process evidence-based to provide appropriate evaluation and recommendations for treatment?\nIs your ED staff educated and supported by behavioral health providers to recognize the warning signs of patients at risk for suicide?\nDo you have policies and procedures in place specific to this patient population?\nDoes your staff follow trauma-informed policies to ensure the patient is treated with respect and in a way that promotes healing and recovery?\nDoes your documentation include a clear and concise review of risk and protective factors and the measures taken to ensure patient safety?\n\nIs your ED staff challenged when dealing with suicidal patients and their families? Specifically,\n\nIs there an awareness of specific groups and their clinical presentations that identifies these groups as higher risk than the general population for suicidal behaviors?\nIs your staff providing appropriate referrals to ensure continuity of care and reduce risk once the patient leaves your ED?\nDoes your staff recognize that patients who present with self-harm injuries are 100 times more at risk of suicide than the general population?\nDoes your staff follow written standardized protocols based on common clinical presentations to allow for more differentiated responses based on each patient’s risk profile and assessed needs?\nHas your ED developed guidelines and competencies to effectively engage families and concerned others as appropriate throughout the care of persons with suicide risk?\n\nThe Horizon Solution\nOver 40 years of experience managing and operating behavioral health programs in acute care hospitals across the United States has prepared Horizon Health Behavioral Health Services to better coordinate the needs of the ED and suicidal patient. Horizon has the experience to engage EDs and behavioral health programs to develop and provide state-of-the-art assessment centers to enhance the safety of patients with suicide risk.\nHorizon begins each evaluation by completing a comprehensive assessment of the ED environment to provide recommendations that will decrease potential environmental risks. Horizon partners with our client hospitals to identify strategies to decrease risks associated with suicidal patients through:\n\nAudit of risk assessments\nDevelopment of assessment tools and policies to improve patient care\nStaff education in the management of the suicidal patient\n\nFor an evaluation of your ED procedures in assessing, treating and referring suicidal patients, contact an organization with more than 37 years of experience, expertise and clinical resources to better manage the suicidal patient in your emergency department.\n'}, {'Title': "It's A Small Piece of the Pie, But You're Left Craving More Without It:", 'Description': 'Psychiatric Programs Can Be Top Performers In Your Hospital’s Menu of Services\nWhite Paper\nPrepared by Horizon Health Behavioral Health Services\nDownload White Paper\n\nPsychiatric Services as Part of the Menu\nHospital executives are challenged with expanding services and exploring new product lines to ensure that patient needs are met while still maintaining a healthy operating margin. Many hospitals avoid psychiatric services because of the challenges involved with a complex patient population and want to ensure the return on investment makes these services worthwhile. Providing behavioral health services creates a tremendous opportunity for hospitals that want to offer something unique and essential in their community. Medicare reimbursement updates to inpatient psychiatric services have been favorable with base rate increases each year.\nCritics Review\nThere are many factors that impact the payment for psychiatric programs. Evaluating these programs requires specialized expertise because psychiatric reimbursement does not emulate that of the discharge based methodology that is used in the acute care setting. Horizon’s experience in managing psychiatric programs has revealed several recurring issues that affect the financial performance. Often providers cap the census to appease nursing staff or physicians. Other times, they put a cap on the length of stay. These tactics can have unfavorable patient care and financial implications. A lack of understanding the minutiae of how the reimbursement is determined can have a detrimental effect on the financial performance of the program. A detailed financial review can identify opportunities for improvement in many different areas.\nOne aspect of the financial review is financial benchmarking. This is a first step in identifying opportunities that will promote financial profitability and obstacles that may prevent the psychiatric program from being a top performer. Horizon has the unique advantage of having hundreds of clients (both current and former) from which to compare financial benchmarks. Areas to specifically focus on from a financial perspective include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nCase Mix\nPayor Mix\nALOS\nNursing Hours Per Patient Day\nContribution Margin\n\n\nA Five Star Experience\nProviders are constantly striving to improve their finances, operations and quality. Many patients who miss out on care do so because of lack of access to appropriate healthcare. A financial review of an existing or proposed psychiatric program is the first step in fully addressing the needs of your community. Shifting the psychiatric emergency care to a psychiatric focused program can improve patient outcomes and overall operating results. A detailed financial review will quickly identify areas that fall outside of established benchmarks and a determination can be made on how to begin turning your psychiatric program into a top performer in your menu of hospital services.\n'}]
