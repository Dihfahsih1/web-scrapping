Except for statements of historical fact, information contained herein constitutes forward-looking information.Forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and is based upon a number of factors and assumptions of management and is subject to a number of risks at the date the statements are made. Please refer to the Interim MD&A and the AIF for, among other things, further details as certain of such factors, assumptions and risks. Further details as to the status of Wesana’s drug development initiatives are also found in the Interim MD&A.Wesana Solutions remains in the beta testing phase. While there is no assurance that product development will be completed and clinical deployment will be achieved nor the extent to which the Company will secure clinical customers for Wesana Solutions once it completes product development and initiates the clinical deployment, the clinic deployment of Wesana Solutions is contemplated to begin in the first quarter of 2022. Certain factors that influence successfully completing beta testing and product development and achieving clinical deployment within such timeline include: (i) the development of this software platform was subcontracted out by the Company and the beta testing phase has been initiated; (ii) third parties and internal product leads have met expected deliverable timelines to date; (iii) to date the Company has not identified any significant issues regarding functionality of the software; (iv) the Company has allocated sufficient funds and resources to complete final product development and marketing plans; and (v) the Company has engaged regulatory and data consultants to monitor regulations impacting commercialization of the software.Certain assumptions that influence successfully completing beta testing and product development and achieving clinical deployment within such timeline include: (i) there are no significant delays in the final development and testing schedule and staffing plans;(ii) beta testing results are positive and supportive of the software being deployed in a clinical setting; (iii) development and marketing costs remaining consistent with the Company’s budgeting; and (iv) the Company will be able to secure future relationships and establish commercial agreements for the software with third party clinics.Certain factors that influence successfully opening a third Wesana Clinic in the first quarter of 2022 include: (i) the Company has identified a third clinic location and property and is currently in lease negotiations; (ii) should the Company procure additional capital and proceed with a lease in connection with the identified third property, renovations and permitting of the property for the purpose of clinic operations are expected to be minimal; (iii) the Company has an internal team dedicated to identifying potential target clinics and locations and evaluating and addressing issues that may arise during due diligence of any potential targets.Certain assumptions that influence successfully opening a third Wesana Clinic in the first quarter of 2022 include: (i) there are no significant delays in executing the third property lease in the fourth quarter of 2021 or shortly thereafter, if additional capital is raised; (ii) additional capital is raised during the fourth quarter of 2021 or shortly thereafter for the third location; and (iii) there are no significant delays in renovation/permitting if the third property lease is executed.The formation of a partnership between the Company and MAPS remains at a preliminary stage.
