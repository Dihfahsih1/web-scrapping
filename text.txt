Anxiety disorders include social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In this blog post, we’ll focus on the latter.\xa0\nWhile general anxiety disorder will affect about 6% of adults, many people will experience symptoms for years before seeking treatment. Others will never seek treatment. When left undiagnosed, untreated, or undertreated, GAD can lead to depression, substance use disorder, and other life-threatening conditions. \xa0 \nWhat Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder?\nGAD is often defined by excessive, pervasive worry that adversely impacts work, social, and academic interactions, as well as other everyday routines.\xa0\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms\nAccording to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America, symptoms of GAD include:\xa0\n\nFeeling nervous, irritable, or on edge\nHaving a sense of impending danger or doom\nDifficulty concentrating\nTrouble sleeping\nIncreased heart rate\nRapid breathing\nSweating\nTrembling\nUpset stomach/nausea (and other gastrointestinal symptoms)\nMuscle tension\n\nFor an official diagnosis, patients typically experience symptoms like these on a near-daily basis for about six months.\xa0\xa0\nWhat Causes Generalized Anxiety Disorder?\nFrom genetics to geography, generalized anxiety disorder has many causes.\xa0\nFamily history: Someone may be more likely to develop GAD if a relative has an anxiety disorder or other mental health condition.\xa0\nPre-existing health conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, can increase someone’s likelihood of developing generalized anxiety disorder.\xa0\nSocial and environmental factors: Violence, abuse, and other traumatic events (especially in childhood) can increase the possibility of GAD. Additionally, those who have experienced poverty, displacement, loss of cultural heritage, or other social inequalities are more vulnerable to developing generalized anxiety disorder.\xa0\nIn addition to family history, pre-existing health conditions, social inequality, and trauma, increasingly common and more recent causes for generalized anxiety disorder include social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme distress about climate change.\xa0\nComplications & Other Considerations for GAD\nGeneralized anxiety disorder often presents with – or can lead to or worsen – other physical or mental health conditions, including:\xa0\n\nDepression\nADHD\nInsomnia\nSubstance use\nSuicide ideation\n\nBecause of the wide range of causes for generalized anxiety disorder, as well potential coexisting conditions, behavioral health facilities can offer a range of treatment and care options.\xa0\nTreatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nEach case of GAD is unique, and, therefore, treatment will vary according to an individual’s needs and specific circumstances. In general, primary care physicians or psychiatrists will recommend medication and psychotherapy/cognitive behavioral therapy–or a combination of these methods.\xa0\nPsychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for GAD: Psychotherapy, often referred to as talk therapy, involves a patient speaking with a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, or social worker about their anxiety disorder. Under this umbrella is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on helping patients address and change their thinking patterns that support their anxiety-induced fears and worries.\xa0\nMedication for GAD: While medication does not cure generalized anxiety disorder, it can help relieve its emotional and physical symptoms. Primary care physicians or psychiatrists may prescribe a medication(s) from one of three drug classifications: anti-anxiety, antidepressants, or beta-blockers.\xa0\nAside from medication and behavioral therapy, people experiencing generalized anxiety disorder might also be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes or seek out additional coping strategies such as dietary changes, meditation, yoga, exercise, or even exploring creative outlets.\xa0\xa0\nHospitalization for Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nAnxiety disorders are typically treated on an outpatient basis. However, in some instances, hospitalization might be appropriate, especially when someone’s symptoms pose a threat to themselves or others.\xa0\nInpatient behavioral health services for someone experiencing generalized anxiety disorder may address both immediate and longer-term needs. Services might include evaluation, treatment planning, medication management, life skills training, recreational therapy, and individual, group, or family therapy. Most hospitalizations for GAD are short-term, but the actual duration of a residential treatment will depend on various factors.\xa0\nPartial Hospitalization Programs for Anxiety Disorders\nPartial hospitalization is another option for people experiencing moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder. This option is for patients who might need more intensive treatment than routine outpatient care, but does not require the 24/7 monitoring hospitalization would provide.\xa0\nPartial hospitalization behavioral health programs usually include a full day of sessions for a total of one to two weeks. These programs are typically community-based, meaning that in addition to individual therapy, patients participate in group sessions and activities.\xa0\nPatient Education and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nLike many other mental health conditions, generalized anxiety disorder often goes undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated. This is for many reasons, from the perceived stigma associated with someone seeking help for a mental health condition to a misdiagnosis from a primary care physician.\nUndiagnosed, misdiagnosed, untreated, or undertreated cases of generalized anxiety disorder can lead to higher use of health services, including hospitalization. That’s why patient education – as well as general community awareness – is so critical in helping people to recognize the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in themselves or others.\xa0\n***\nAmong its many solutions for behavioral health programs, Horizon Health helps inpatient and outpatient BHUs identify strategies to increase access to mental health care, as well as to improve mental health outcomes and expand community outreach.

By creating a culture of safety among an entire BHU team, we can aim to reduce those rates even further.\xa0\nIn this blog post, we’ll share two ways to help increase safety in a behavioral health unit: 15-Minute Safety Checks & Environmental Rounding.\xa0\n15-Minute Safety Checks\nThe first way to help reduce risk is by consistently observing the patient.\xa0 We call these observations, 15-minute checks.\xa0 Checking on patients at regular intervals – no more than 15-minutes between observations or checks has become an industry standard to minimize the risk for self-harm, violence, and death by suicide.\xa0\nRebecca Dvorak, senior vice president for clinical practice at Horizon Health, is a strong proponent of safety checks in behavioral health. \xa0 “The consistent checks by staff is a foundation of safety in a behavioral health program.\xa0 At least every 15-minutes, a staff member should lay eyes on the patient, ensuring their needs are being met and they are safe in the environment,” she says.\xa0\nDvorak, who helps hospitals build, develop and improve behavioral health programs, adds that 15-minute checks in a BHU is more than laying eyes on a patient; it’s also about assessing the environment. She walks us through an imaginary scenario of what that might look like when performing 15-minute checks: “Does the person appear safe? Does anything look out of place? Do they have more belongings than required (extra sheets, towels, clothes), which could pose a risk to them or others?”\xa0\xa0\xa0\nA typical 15-minute check might include:\xa0\n\nMaking eye contact with the patient\nObserving mood and behavior\nEnsuring the patient is in no acute distress\xa0\nVisually observing the physical environment for anything unsafe – or for any restricted items\n\n[Note: It’s important to clarify that 15-minute checks are not recommended for patients at an elevated or extreme risk of suicide; rather, these patients should be placed under close observation.\xa0 This involves constant, one-to-one monitoring by a behavioral health professional who stays within arm’s distance of the person at all times to ensure safety.]\xa0\nEnvironmental Rounding\nThe second way staff help keep patients safe on behavioral health units is by performing environmental rounds.\xa0 Environmental rounds are used to assess the area/unit for any potential risks to the patient and/or staff.\xa0\xa0\nDuring an environmental round, an assigned staff member walks the unit, including all patient care and non-patient care areas.\xa0 The staff member is looking for any items that could harm, or be used to cause harm, to a patient and/or staff person.\xa0\xa0\nEnvironmental rounding is performed in a couple of different ways. The first is a more formal approach, which is completed every shift, utilizing a standardized tool and documented.\xa0 The second way is by completing environmental checks each time the staff member completes a 15-minute safety check.\xa0 Combining both of these methods helps to ensure that the environment is continually being assessed and kept safe at all times.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nIn Summary\nIn behavioral health safety has to be taken into consideration at all times.\xa0 15-minute safety checks and environmental rounding are just two of the ways behavioral health leaders help keep the patients and staff safe.\xa0 “As healthcare workers it is our duty, our responsibility, to keep patients safe while they are in the hospital,” says Dvorak, adding that 15-minute checks and environmental rounding can help minimize risk and, thus, improve safety in behavioral health units. “The reality is, patient safety events are preventable.”\xa0\xa0\n***\nAmong its many solutions for behavioral health programs, Horizon Health’s Clinical Resources team helps inpatient and outpatient BHUs identify strategies to minimize risk and ensure safety of all patients and staff.

on your hospital’s success, it is important to appreciate the opportunity surveys present to you.\xa0 The view of dread or opportunity greatly relies on the prioritization you place on your survey preparedness.\xa0 A survey, if properly prepared can be an exciting way to showcase the quality of work you and your team do every day.\xa0\nThe Importance of Preparing for Surveys\nFor many Nurse Managers, the survey can be a top stressor that results in several events of trial and error until you finally learn how to prepare for survey.\xa0 Once you have the right practices in line, surveys can easily go from a dreaded part of the job to a celebration of you and your team.\nHow to Achieve Survey Preparedness\nStep 1: Become an Expert in Knowing Your State, Federal and Accrediting agency (Joint Commission/DNV/HFAP) regulations.\nYour ability to better understand regulatory compliance means more than just reviewing your regulations, it means adopting them as part of your standard way of doing business.\xa0 Love them or hate them, they’re your key to regulatory compliance.\xa0 Rather than fighting an uphill battle of attempting to challenge regulations you don’t like, be able to speak to them and implement them into your policies and practices.\xa0 The Joint Commission has free resources to help you in the process including a\xa0Readiness Checklist for Joint Commission Behavioral Health Care Accreditation.\xa0\nIf your team is struggling with certain regulations, instead of losing valuable time resisting those regulations, find a way to address your concerns and overcome them.\xa0 Developing a survey preparedness committee can be a proactive approach to solving how to meet the intent of the regulation.\xa0\nEffective Performance Improvement Committees are Not a Meeting of Nay-Sayers.\xa0\nIf you’ve taken the step of launching a committee, chances are, there are enough voices that disagree with some of the regulations.\xa0 Be protective of this committee and be sure it does not become a complaint committee.\xa0 Identify what the real concerns are with the regulation.\xa0 It could be a lack of clinical resources, costs-based or something that feels too out of reach to achieve.\xa0 By allowing a free-flow of concerns (not complaints), you can be more successful in addressing any limitation your staff is concerned about in meeting your state’s regulations.\nStep 2: Be the Expert of Your Own Policies\nHow well do you understand and execute on your own regulatory compliance policies and procedures?\xa0 Whether it’s a regulation from CMS, your state, your hospital’s accrediting agency (JC, HFAP/DNV) or your hospital’s own practices, your policies are in place to help guide the care provided in a quality-driven manner.\xa0\xa0\nJust as you will do with step 1, it’s critical that you be the champion of your internal policies and procedures.\xa0 Some employees merely glance at the policies, some may not know where to find them.\xa0 Others may have read them but couldn’t explain what they mean.\xa0 A big piece of survey preparedness is policy adoption.\xa0 More than agreeing to them, your team needs to adopt them into their daily practices and that starts with your ability to turn them into policy advocates, not policy adversaries.\nStep 3: Make Survey Preparations a Part of Your Daily Practice\nAudits are a key piece to your survey success.\xa0 Surveyors tend to spend more time reviewing records than anything else.\xa0 Auditing your charts can have a powerful impact on improving your surveys.\xa0 Knowing what your charts say will drive you to improve them.\xa0 Don’t overlook this important step.\xa0 Imagine yourself sitting down with a surveyor as they begin reviewing records, only to have the surveyor point out simple violations you had no idea were being made.\xa0 Don’t let that be you.\nYour Environment Advertises Your Survey Preparedness\nA surveyor’s first impression begins with your unit.\xa0 Walking through with a more critical eye can lead to better results.\xa0 There’s more to this than simply knowing the layout of your unit.\xa0 If you want to create a better first impression, be more present and aware of your unit.\xa0 This means knowing where your vulnerabilities are every single day.\xa0 These can change frequently based on who is working each shift and the types of patients you have.\nA daily walk-through will go a long way.\xa0 All staff, including leaders should be completing a walk-through every day with the objective of identifying and correcting areas of concern.\xa0 Be sure items aren’t left in the hallway, doors aren’t left propped open.\xa0 Check all of the logs.\xa0 Gauge the overall cleanliness of the unit and make sure programming is running on time.\xa0 You’ll be celebrating when you spare yourself an embarrassing walk through with surveyors seeing issues that could have been easily avoided if you had taken the small extra steps of addressing these issues on your own.\nBetter Surveys Begins with You\nIt may seem daunting at first, but the steps we’ve outlined are achievable if you improve your preparation habits.\xa0 Accept that they’re needed and then learn to adopt them.\xa0 Eventually, you’ll learn to love and appreciate them because of the success you’re achieving due to better surveys.\xa0\nFeeling overwhelmed by surveys?\xa0 Horizon Health can help with your survey preparedness.\xa0 Our\xa0Clinical Resources team has several tools and training opportunities to help your team become more effective in preparing for surveys. \xa0Contact us

He was always planning family camping trips in the summer for my mother, sister, brother and I.\xa0 What great memories I have of trips to Yellowstone National Park, the Badlands, Teton National Park and the Great Smokey Mountains.\nIt was the summer of 1968, as a young boy of 11 years old, during our trip to the Great Smokey Mountains that I first noticed it. My dad was having trouble putting up our tent. He could not seem to lift the canvas up to the sprocket to secure the tent. He didn’t seem to think anything of it, yet I knew it bothered him.\nImmediately upon returning home from our trip, my dad climbed down the stairs to our basement to lift weights in hopes of building up his strength again. His strength did not improve.\nI remember seeing the concern on his face as he spoke to my mom. This led to his many trips to the doctors’ offices and many tests. Finally he contacted a high school classmate of his who had become a physician at the National Institute of Health in Washington DC. After a battery of tests, the diagnosis came back— a very rare muscular decease called Nemo Rod Myopathy. \xa0At that time, the NIH data showed that only 50 people in the United States had been diagnosed with this disease. The team of physicians treating my father said it was not very aggressive and his life span could be another 25-30 years. At the time he was 36 years old.\nThe disease progressed much more rapidly than original diagnosed. Over time my dad lost his ability to walk without help. First he needed the assistance of a cane, then a wheelchair. Being the positive person he was, he rallied the family around him. We all became caregivers at very young ages. We became experts on how to drive the wheelchair, use a hoya lift, and even put on surgical gloves to provide suctioning for fluid in his lungs.\nI saw how hard my dad worked just to do the simple things in life, like eating and breathing. His attitude always remained positive, despite all of his physical limitations. He always had time for my siblings and me to discuss schoolwork or any social issues we were having. Toward the end of his life he lost his voice and we had to learn how to read his lips to communicate. In September of 1973 he passed, with his mind intact but his body had lost all muscle function.\nI look at back at those days and draw strength from the lessons learned.\xa0 These lessons are applicable today as I see that fear has become a part of many peoples’ lives during this pandemic.\nMany people are anxious, or are experiencing depression. So I ask us all to take a step back and look for the silver linings in our lives. These silver linings are the people who impact our lives for good and have shaped us into who and what we are today. We’ve learned valuable lessons from their strength, positive influence, resilience and perseverance in the face of severe challenges.\xa0 If those people are still with us today, reach out to them. \xa0\xa0Reconnect.\xa0 Tell them you love them.

Superstitions are really a reaction to feeling out of control,” says Eric Hamerman, an assistant professor of marketing at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. “People like to put a sense of control around chaos or uncertainty.”\nIf you’re like most people, you occasionally participate in superstitious thinking or behavior often without even realizing you’re doing it. \xa0Think about it. \xa0When was the last time you knocked on wood? \xa0Walked within the lines? \xa0Avoided a black cat? \xa0Or, read your daily horoscope? These are all examples of superstitions or what Stuart Vyse, PhD, and the author of Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition, calls magical thinking.\nDr. Vyse says, “In our quest to understand superstitions, let’s start by defining them. After all, not all rituals or beliefs are superstitions. The dividing line is whether you give some kind of magical significance to the ritual.”\nBased on Dr. Vyse’s research, it appears my nap and pasta before a game can be a useful ritual that calms me down and gives me the appropriate fuel to perform at a high level.\xa0 He says that by believing my shamrock pants helped win a big football game, I’m probably entering superstitious territory.\nNow that I think about it, Notre Dame hasn’t won the national championship in 30 plus years, and I’m no closer to the PGA tour at 47 than when I started my “no green tees” superstition.\xa0 Perhaps my focus should be on preparation and the things I really can control, and let someone else enjoy the benefits of that lost penny.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Winter Blues: Is There Really Such a Thing?', 'Description: ': '\nWinter Blues: Is There Really Such a Thing?\nDepression severity does not seem to be impacted by seasonality and instead varies by demographics.\xa0 Outcomes data clearly show facilities can help patients resolve to take care of themselves whether snow, rain, sleet or shine!\n\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Wisdom and Connection: Meaningful Deterrents to Loneliness', 'Description: ': '\nWisdom and Connection: Meaningful Deterrents to Loneliness\nimage from kevinmd.com\nDO YOU HAVE A SOURCE OF JOY IN YOUR LIFE?\nDO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF PEACE TODAY?\nHow would you answer these questions?\xa0 One health system started asking their patients these questions 2 years ago, hoping to discover “needs beyond the physical realm.” Why such interest?\nThere is a strong body of research that shows that feeling lonely impacts physical and mental health and their treatment outcomes.\n“Loneliness seems to be associated with everything bad.\xa0 It’s linked to poor mental health, substance abuse, cognitive impairment, and worse physical health, including malnutrition, hypertension and disrupted sleep.”\xa0(LaFee, December 2018)\nThe former US Surgeon General, Vivek Murphy said, “ A prevailing pall of loneliness in the United States poses a greater, more intractable public health crisis than tobacco use or obesity.”\xa0 It has been shown that\xa0 “those who are socially isolated have a 50% higher chance of death compared with those who aren’t, likening it to smoking 15 cigarettes a day!”\xa0(Castellucci, January 13, 2020)\nIf loneliness can be decreased, there is a hope that the need for medical services will decrease and overall well-being will increase. Millions of dollars have already been spent by those in healthcare to dive deeper and figure out, What is loneliness? Who is lonely? \xa0Why are they lonely? And, how can we prevent/decrease loneliness?\nWHAT IS LONLINESS?\nLoneliness is more of a mental state of being than it is a physical one.\xa0 One can be surrounded by people and feel lonely or all by themselves and not feel lonely.\xa0 It is a difficult quality to quantify in research and is oftentimes measured by people’s perception of loneliness, perceived support and satisfaction in relationships. (Schulze, April 16,2018)\nWHO IS LONELY?\nWe all know what it feels like to be lonely, and no one likes it but it seems to be a state of ebb and flow through our lifetime.\xa0 Studies and surveys have shown that 17% – 75% of the United States’ general population have moderate to high levels of loneliness!\xa0\xa0\xa0 It’s been found that loneliness is heightened in the late 20s, mid 50s and late 80s.\xa0 Loneliness is a shared experience we all go through from time to time.\nWHY ARE PEOPLE LONELY?\nThis is a complex question to answer.\xa0 We might tend to feel lonely when we are in a new setting and not familiar with the people around us; when we move locations and have to start over and figure out how to become part of a new community; when a relationship ends; the death of a loved one; when we don’t feel a part of something we wish we were, etc.\xa0 There are many triggers to loneliness.\nI like the visual that I found on a blog posted by an Undergraduate at Harvard\xa0 that noted that the amount of social connections and strength of those connections make a large impact on the level on loneliness found in individuals studied.\n\xa0\nFigure 1: The basics of social network sizing. An average network has several close ties that are often in contact and many acquaintances that add substance to the network. A low scoring network has more weak or absent ties that lack qualities like mutual confiding or reciprocal interest.\xa0(Schulze, April 16,2018)\nIt speaks to the idea that regardless of what challenges and setbacks come our way, if we have solid social connections, we will find comfort, support, strength and inspiration to move forward and not get bogged down in loneliness.\nHOW CAN WE PREVENT/DECREASE LONELINESS?\nLoneliness is not something that can be prevented, but we can be proactive at keeping it at bay in our lives.\xa0\xa0 What’s a good first step?\xa0 As previously stated, create meaningful connections in our lives. \xa0Connections can be made everywhere!\xa0 At home, work, school, church, neighborhood, sporting events, community centers, classes, etc. \xa0This requires us to step outside our comfort zone and actively spend time with people and share in common experiences.\nIn research done by Dilip Jeste, MD, Professor of Psychiatry and Neurosciences and Director of the UC San Diego Center for Health Aging, he “found a strong inverse association between wisdom and loneliness. People who were deemed wiser were less lonely.”\xa0(LaFee, December 2018) \xa0\xa0So, acquiring wisdom is a good second step shown to counteract loneliness.\nWisdom has been studied in Psychology and its definition continues to expand as time goes on.\xa0 Several theories exist, but the most detailed definition currently acknowledged by the academic community was created by Meeks and Jeste (2009) as they reviewed the literature and identified commonalities.\xa0 They came up with 6 components of wisdom:\n\nProsocial attitudes/behaviors: promotion of common good,\xa0empathy, social cooperation, and altruism\nSocial decision making/pragmatic knowledge of life: understanding others’\xa0emotions\xa0and motivations and using the information to make “wise” social decisions\nEmotional homeostasis: self-control and impulse control; ability to manage oneself in challenging situations\nReflection/self-understanding: Self-knowledge\nValue relativism/tolerance: perspective-taking behavior\nAcknowledgment of and dealing effectively with uncertainty/ambiguity: navigating uncertainty and acknowledging/accepting the limits of what one knows.\xa0(Miller, April 7, 2019)\n\nThis insight provides such depth to wisdom.\xa0 Wisdom is the acquiring of attributes that help us understand ourselves and others.\xa0 It helps us to make the best choices we can, in various situations.\xa0 If we are wise, then by this theory, we have honed the skills necessary for positive interaction with others and with ourselves.\xa0 It links perfectly with the other counteracting factor to loneliness: connection.\xa0 If our wisdom is well developed, we have the skills necessary to navigate our social world in a positive, impactful and ultimately, meaningful way that will naturally lend itself to social competency and internal peace and fulfillment.\nWisdom also lends itself to know when a connection/activity is worth investing in and when it is not.\xa0 It helps us not to wear ourselves out on matters/connections of little consequence, but to be wise and focus attention and energy on people or activities that will yield positive results in our lives.\nLet’s be wise and let’s connect!\xa0 It will make all the difference in our physical and mental health and undoubtedly enrich our lives and the lives of those with which we are connected, helping us all to keep loneliness to a minimum.\xa0 And, perhaps when we do have that overwhelming feeling of being alone, which we will, we can see it as an opportunity to evaluate where our focus and energy is and what we can do to increase our wisdom and deepen or create new connections.\nCastellucci, M.

Curiosity is that strong desire to know or learn something. A significant number of caregivers are not asking deeper questions. We are not seeking to generate genuine curiosity around an issue to create deeper more sustainable solutions. Payers, accreditation and regulatory organizations don’t appear to ask deeper questions either. We naturally gravitate to easier solutions, but there is a cost.\nPatients and families worry that caregivers do not seem to have a genuine concern for them. Physician’s worry too. Physicians report that the focus in modern medicine is not to deeply explore patients’ concerns; instead, they compare their daily work to being in a factory, disconnected from their patients. Some worry that curiosity in medicine is dying. Meanwhile, medical errors are a leading cause of death. There’s some debate on the real number but let’s agree that systemic problems, miscommunication, not-so-patient-centered care, poorly coordinated care, over and under diagnosing, unwarranted practice pattern variation, and lack of accountability leave us with a number that’s way too high. In this environment, curiosity is not a soft skill it is a core competency.\nCuriosity: Trait or State?\nMost research differentiates two types of curiosity. Trait curiosity – a natural inclination to be curious; and State curiosity –\nthe ability to become curious. It is this ability to become curious that can be developed. Professor Todd Kashdan, a leading\ncuriosity researcher, provides practical insight into four components or ingredients of curiosity:\n\nInquisitiveness – the “preference for the new and unfamiliar“;\nDeprivation Sensitivity – “Recognizing a gap in knowledge and attempting to reduce it”\nOpenness – “taking the view of people other than myself“;\n\xa0Distress tolerance – the ability to be adaptable, “to tolerate the stress of the new” so that you can and will\xa0 \xa0act on new learnings.\n\nFrancesca Gino, a behavioral scientist says our barriers to a curious culture are:\n\nHaving the wrong mindset about exploration\nSeeking efficiency over exploration.\n\nOne study showed that 66% of employees reported that they face barriers to asking more questions at work, and only 22% describe themselves as “curious” at work. Only 12% of workers report that their employers are extremely encouraging of curiosity. When comparing industries, healthcare was labeled a “Laggard”! We were less curious than insurance companies, and barely beating financial services and public administration. We need to up our game; we literally have people’s lives in our hands.\nDeveloping a Curious Culture\nHere are some ideas for building a more curiosity driven culture:\n\nHire for curiosity: Hire staff who want to learn, and then let them!\nIncrease your diversity of inputs: Ask, “How could something that works over there, work\nhere?”\nAsk more and better questions: Provocative, open-ended questions. Use outcomes data\nto get you started!\nReframe failure as a tool for learning, and de-shame it: Ask “What could we do better?” or\n“What did we learn?”\nWork on tolerating uncertainty: Celebrate and encourage calculated risk taking and experimentation.\n\xa0Put Curiosity on display: Celebrate great questions and new solutions.\n\nWhat if we supported deeper learning and better conversations across more people about what\nmight make healthcare better? The data shows there is room for improvement.

Being prepared for survey is not a one-time deal. It is something that is ongoing, not just when you are in your survey window.\nI have to admit that when I was a Nurse Manager, a CNO, and now in my current roll, I kind of liked surveys. YIKES!!! Yep, I just said that.\xa0 I like surveys! \xa0I know, everybody roll your eyes! I am sure you are thinking, is this lady being serious?! Don’t get me wrong. \xa0It’s not like I dream about constantly being in survey. Surveys can be exciting, in a good way. Surveys are an opportunity to show off all the great work we do every single day.\nWhen I first started in a leadership role I didn’t really know how to prepare for surveys. I had seen what my predecessors had done, so I just mimicked that. My first year as Nurse Manager was met with many challenges and survey was the #1 challenge. It wasn’t until I went through several, meaning a survey almost every other month for a year, that I figured out how to prepare for survey. I had no choice, except to learn fairly quickly all about regulations. I learned what happens when you are not meeting the regulations and what it looks like when you are meeting them. \xa0The latter feels AWESOME!!\nThere are many things that units can do to prepare for survey. \xa0I’d like to highlight the 3 top things to do. If you do these, it should create a domino effect and other things fall into place.\n#1 Know your State, Federal and Accrediting agency (Joint Commission/DNV/HFAP) regulations.\nKnowledge is power! Knowing your regulations is key to a successful survey. Read the regulations. \xa0Be able to speak to them and implement them in your policies and practices. One of the biggest pitfalls I have seen is when healthcare providers challenge the regulations. Meaning, if they don’t like the regulation they spend too much time trying to figure out how to not follow it. That is not a great use of time or energy. \xa0Simply put — not helpful.\nAs healthcare providers, we may not always agree with the regulations, but we still have to follow them. If you disagree with a regulation and spend time debating with others about it, you are wasting precious survey prep time. Regulations are put into place for a reason. \xa0More often than not, it is for safety. \xa0At times we disagree with a regulation simply because it’s a challenging one for us to meet. Maybe we don’t think we have enough staff. Maybe the cost to replace or fix something seems too great. Maybe we simply do not understand what the regulation is asking.\nI encourage you to identify those regulations that you or your team is struggling with. Develop a committee, similar to a Performance Improvement team/committee. The committee’s goal is to figure out how you will meet the intent of the regulation. Again, keeping in mind that the team is not in place to discuss how much everyone disagrees with the regulation.\n#2: Know your own policies.\n\xa0Policies and procedures are written for a reason. Sometimes it is a regulation from CMS, your state, your hospital’s accrediting agency (JC, HFAP/DNV) or your hospital’s own practices. Ultimately, policies are in place to help guide the care we provide in a consistent, quality-driven manner.\nMake sure your staff know what your policies say and/or how to access them. I have had staff tell me they don’t even know how to access their own polices. Or maybe they can access the policies, but do not have a clue as to what they say. Sometimes I get the ever classic, “Huh, I have no idea what you are talking about.”\nMost helpful tip I can offer here is—read your policies.\n#3: Daily preparations.\n\xa0Audit the patient records:\nI know that everybody reading this feels the same way I do about chart audits…We all LOVE THEM, right? Right? Ok, ok…everybody stop rolling your eyes. In all seriousness, I do love chart audits and for a very good reason.\nAudits are an important part of the success of your survey. Surveyors tend to spend more time reviewing records than anything else. Knowing what is in the charts is key to fixing them. You need to be in your charts every day, not just the leaders of the unit, everybody. Nobody wants to sit down with a surveyor and begin reviewing records only to have the surveyor point out simple violations you had no idea were \xa0being made.\nWalk-through of the environment:\nI read an article once that said, first impressions occur in the first 7 seconds of a meeting. A surveyor’s first impression of us and our unit is a big piece of a successful survey. In order to have a successful first impression, you have to be ready at all times. You need to know your unit. Knowing your unit is not the same as knowing the layout. It is about knowing where your vulnerabilities are every single day. This changes based on who is working that shift and what types of patients you have.\nA daily walk-through is key. All staff, including leaders should be completing a walk-through every single day. You need to identify and fix any areas of concern. If there are items in the hallway, move them. Doors left propped open? \xa0Lock them. Check all logs. Look for the overall cleanliness of the unit and make sure programming is running on time. There is nothing more frustrating and quite frankly embarrassing than walking the unit with surveyors and seeing things for the first time that could have been fixed.\nSo there you have it! Survey preparedness in a snap shot. Go forth and prep for survey!\nBlog contributor: Becky Dvorak, Senior Vice President of Clinical Practice for Horizon Health\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Step-down Outpatient Care Outcomes Following an Inpatient Stay', 'Description: ': '\nStep-down Outpatient Care Outcomes Following an Inpatient Stay\n\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Multi-Tasking Myth or Reality?', 'Description: ': '\nMulti-Tasking Myth or Reality?\nPhoto credit: https://www.brainscape.com/\nI recently presented a Program Director candidate to a hospital for review and consideration to fill an open position. The resume was well received and the hospital thought the candidate might be a good fit for their facility. The hospital then asked me how I could prove the candidate had superior multi-tasking skills.\nFortunately the question was in an email, which gave me time to think about the answer. While I have been asked numerous times to provide insight on a candidate’s multi-tasking ability, I had never been asked to prove it. I responded to the hospital that to me, proof was the candidate’s previous history of successfully leading organizational change and consistently delivering multiple on time projects. The hospital accepted the answer, but I was left questioning how multi-tasking had become a rule in/rule out component of an individual’s candidacy for a position.\nI began to read about multi-tasking. The concept of multi-tasking was put forth by Datamation Magazine in 1966 to refer to a single CPU’s ability to process two or more jobs at once. In the 1990’s when computing technology made its way into mainstream society, multi–tasking began to refer to a human’s ability or action capability. From the 1990’s to present the term has gained increasing popularity, and is often used to describe an individual who can successfully handle many different projects, meet deadlines, and provide multiple deliverables on time.\nIn the past five years there has been a proliferation of research and articles about the myth of multi-tasking. To summarize popular thought – multi-tasking is a myth, and often detrimental to accomplishing work. Wikipedia states “an example of (human) multi-tasking is taking phone calls while typing an email and reading a book. Multi-tasking can result in time wasted due to human context shifting and apparently cause more errors due to insufficient attention”.\nI have always thought I had pretty good multi-tasking skills, but now that belief is challenged. I can’t effectively read a book, answer an email, talk on the phone and devote full attention to all these activities simultaneously. I know that one task would compete with another and I would become distracted, and likely miss something important.\nAt the end of my reading on this topic, I concluded that for us to be successful we really need superior organizational skills, not multi-tasking skills. How often have we all heard a negative statement about someone who is isn’t performing up to potential? The statement “He or she can’t get anything done; they’re so disorganized” is heard frequently. Multi-tasking is in reality the sum of approaching all tasks in an organized manner to increase the likelihood of success.\nAt Horizon Health we have tools to support our desire to be organized. The action plan template is my personal favorite.For tasks large or small it forces the writer to sequentially organize a task into small increments , set goals, and it’s a great reporting tool on the progress of a project. It allows the reader to see very quickly if a project is on task or has derailed.\nI have always had very positive feedback from hospitals when using an action plan, and updating it to keep them\nknowledgeable about a project. I would also suggest that we all find ways to interview candidates for organizational skills, and not multi-tasking skills. We can’t change a hospital’s perception that multi-tasking is essential to success, but we can change how we view a candidate’s adequacy for a position.\nBlog Contributor: Mary Bishop, Vice President of Operations for Horizon Health\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Residential Youth Self-Reported Behavioral Problems', 'Description: ': '\nResidential Youth Self-Reported Behavioral Problems\nRegardless of level of care, youth can experience difficulties across behavioral domains.

His chances of continued recovery were slim.\xa0\xa0 He would be able to hold out for a while, but sooner rather than later he would be back, he said.\xa0 He would be back in my office, talking about how excited he was to finally “get clean” and he would mean it.\xa0 Again.\nAddiction treatment does not end at the time of discharge.\xa0 Services such as job training, housing assistance, support group enrollment, individual and group counseling and peer support all need to be in place for a successful recovery.\xa0 It is very unlikely that a patient that returns to the same living environment, hangs around the same people, and is tempted by the same substances they sought treatment for will have the strength and fortitude to withstand and remain clean.\xa0 Unfortunately, it is very difficult to monitor individuals once they return to their community. \xa0Often times their socioeconomics will dictate their ability to change their living environment and escape detrimental influences.\nHowever, an inpatient addiction treatment program that offers NA or AA meetings on-site and encourages patient attendance prior to discharge affords their patients an increased chance of continued sobriety post discharge.\xa0 Housing support and job training programs along with emotional support is key to continued recovery.\xa0 As a profession and a society, we need to continue to find better ways to develop, fund and encourage the use of aftercare programs and support systems so the story outlined above becomes the exception and not the norm.\xa0 Sometimes it’s not as simple as, Just Say No.\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Is Newer Always Better?

Dirt and silt became more plentiful than blades of grass.\nSome awesome people I know decided as a service project to plant sod in my front yard and beautify my front yard once more, and all for free. The effort of 12 or so people yielded the hope of lush grass once again.\nLush grass, however, was not a guarantee, just a possibility. It would require watering the grass two times a day. Most of the grass could be watered by my sprinkler system; however, there were 5 different spots that required hand watering twice daily. That meant that I had to roll out of bed 30 minutes earlier for 2 weeks to water my lawn before work and then take the time to water it again at dusk. I enlisted my oldest son to help when he could.\nGetting our grass back to where we wanted it to be required a dedicated sacrifice for 2 weeks. After one week of this regimen, we started to really see a difference. The grass was starting to green up and grow. At a week and a half, you could barely see any of the sod seams and the grass was growing in nicely. By the end of the two-week period of time, the rolls of sod had blended together and created a beautiful green front lawn!\nOf course, keeping the lawn healthy, green and lush will require maintenance. Proper sunlight, sufficient watering, mowing, weeding and fertilizing are all necessary to keep our newest pride and joy in tip-top shape. While it no longer requires intense attention, it still requires consistent attention to remain healthy. And, in fact, 2 months down the line, it has brown patches still cropping up here and there, requiring an extra dose of watering to bring it back.\nThrough this experience I saw truth in the words: THE GRASS IS GREENER WHERE YOU WATER IT and witnessed how the literal watering of my lawn produced growth, beauty and actual happiness! This is an analogy for life!\nYOUR MENTAL HEALTH\nWhen it comes to your mental health and well-being, what do you look like? Are you lusciously thriving, barely holding on, or being overcome by barren spots and weeds?\nWhat needs watering in your life? What do you have hopes of rescuing, revitalizing, or renewing when it comes to your mental health? How can you make this happen?\nTIME FOR A GAME PLAN\nWe can start by developing a game plan to strengthen and beautify that patch of grass and then put it into play.\n1. Be contemplative and pick a goal or two that you want to work on to increase your mental well-being. Choose to get up out of bed on time, meditate daily, or commit to seeing a therapist or joining an addiction recovery group and consistently attend.\xa0 Whatever your choice is, make sure you choose something that you personally are motivated to achieve, not something that overwhelms you and makes you want to give up from the get-go.\n2. Now, come up with the steps you need to achieve the goal and commit to taking them. It may be difficult at first as you sacrifice and change behavior/practices, but over time they will become part of your everyday life.\xa0This is an interesting read on habit-forming. There is no magic number as we’ve been conditioned to believe! It actually takes longer than 21/30 days to form a new habit.)\n3. Go to work!

With everything from physical plant, to regulations and certifications, to personnel, this is not your med/surg floor. Ask anyone who has implemented, or attempted to implement a program. It’s different and justifies partnering with experts that can help guide the design and build process, and manage the unit.\nWith the average 12-bed unit requiring around 7,500 square feet and renovation cost ranging from $225 -$300 per square foot, errors in the planning and design process can be costly. It is paramount that you locate an architect with plenty of behavioral health renovation experience and is licensed in your state. They will start by doing a conceptual test fit to determine the number of beds that can fit in the space. Then determinations can be made if private, semi-private, or a combination, will work best while still meeting clinical needs.\nOnce you have the bed count the financial pro formas need to be completed. This is again where experienced clinical, operational, marketing and financial input is invaluable for determining staffing, salaries and financial assumptions. A lot of mistakes can be made here. This is a big Buyer Beware moment. You will need a team that can put together an accurate and realistic behavioral health bed need. Will your market support an 80% occupancy of a 12-bed unit?\xa0 A 10-bed unit? There are a lot of variables that a very experienced operational and marketing team need to analyze.\nThe next step is for the architect to complete a feasibility assessment of the actual space to be renovated. This is more involved, as the architect needs to visit the space and coordinate with onsite physical plant personnel as well as local contractor talent. The architect will present a conceptual budget to the management team once completed.\nOnce all of this information is collected and analyzed, it is time for senior management to make a go or no-go decision. If the decision is to move forward, it’s time to begin securing financing or budget approval.\nFrom here, all the various applications (CON if applicable) will begin at the local, state and federal level. These will cover the gambit from clinical to construction. A support team can help with everything from recruiting management staff and providers to assisting with various purchasing decisions regarding furniture and equipment. More so than any other department in the hospital, some very specific and uniquely important decisions need to be made— right down to the pattern of the floor tile. \xa0\xa0An experienced support team in the trenches is invaluable for the smooth implementation of this very unique service line.\n'}, {'Title: ': 'Examining Youth Residential Treatment Programs', 'Description: ': '\nExamining Youth Residential Treatment Programs\n\n'}, {'Title: ': 'My Aunt Dot', 'Description: ': '\nMy Aunt Dot\n\nAunt Dorothy was different.\xa0 As a child, I didn’t appreciate those differences.\xa0 I recall the day that she insisted my sister could fit one more tablespoon of cream into her mason jar.\xa0 After all, she was paying us for the cream.\xa0 My mother laughed about it when Aunt Dot left our farmhouse that morning.\nDot was an avid walker – five miles every morning before preparing breakfast for her family.

Safe-staffing ratios are developed to support the types of patients and goals of the program. Nursing research has consistently supported the association between staffing levels and risk management. Staffing below target levels tends to be associated with higher mortality, higher rates of specific infections, and more patient falls.\nBut is there a relationship between staffing and clinical outcomes or\xa0patient satisfaction for psychiatric units? \nOne theory is that as nursing hours per patient day increase, there is a direct increase in positive outcomes and decrease in negative outcomes. However, our data for inpatient psychiatric units do not\xa0support this relationship.\nFor adult units, no specific relationships between nursing hours and outcomes or satisfaction were found. However for geriatric units, one counterintuitive relationship was notable. Patient satisfaction decreased as nursing hours increased.\nWhy don’t more nursing hours lead to better outcomes?\nThough we don’t see consistent relationships between higher nursing hours per patient day and better outcomes in this data, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a relationship of some kind. This just demonstrates satisfaction and clinical outcomes are complex phenomenon influenced by a variety of staffing factors beyond staffing ratios, and\xa0can be difficult to quantify.\nTimely review of outcomes and satisfaction measures will help determine if the nursing staff is effective in meeting patient needs. For inpatient psychiatric units safe-staffing thresholds are important, but once that level is met, improved patient outcomes likely wouldn’t follow simply by adding more staff. In fact, the relationship seen for geriatric units between higher nursing hours per patient day\xa0and lower satisfaction illustrates that there isn’t an inherent benefit to higher staffing ratios.\nOur data suggest there are many factors that influence clinical outcomes and satisfaction and more staff does not necessarily mean better outcomes.\nHAVE A QUESTION FOR CQI+?

The question, “Why are so many patients admitted close to their birthday?” was posed to Mental Health Outcomes. The answer is simple: They aren’t.
