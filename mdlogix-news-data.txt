[{'Title': '\n\r\n                                        New School-Based Mobile Crisis Team in Solano County                \n', 'Description': '\nCalifornia’s Solano County Office of Education (SCOE) began using bhworks software platform from mdlogix in 2019. SCOE is a partner to Solano County’s six school districts, providing services and oversight that help them serve approximately 64,000 students.\n\n\n\n\nAs this previous article notes, SCOE began using the platform to manage the behavioral health issues of students at the county’s community school sites, where students face higher risk for dropping out, emotional problems, suicide ideation, and substance use issues.\nUsing a tablet or mobile device, students answer questions about depression, anxiety, trauma, substance use, eating behaviors, bullying, abuse, suicidal ideation, gun access, and other risk factors. Responses are automatically scored, summarized, and ready for review by qualified staff.\nWith bhworks, SCOE has the needed reports for the AVATAR, a cloud-based, web-accessible Electronic Health Record (EHR) system used throughout most of California.\nThey recently created a network of culturally responsive school Wellness Centers across 25 K-12 school sites. These centers offer students a calm refuge whenever needed, tools for self-management, mindfulness meditation, group psycho-social counseling, and trauma support. The spaces are culturally and linguistically welcoming and accessible to all students.\nThe funding for these efforts came from fiscal years 2020 to 2024, $4 million grant from the state Mental Health Services Act. This Act also funds SCOE’s latest program, mobile crisis.\n\xa0\nMobile Crisis Teams Established\nMobile crisis teams were launched in August 2021 and are desperately needed following the quarantine. While they received funding for the program in September 2020, SCOE couldn’t launch it until last August because of the pandemic.\nThe mobile crisis teams have four trained clinicians, with a 5th clinician joining this year, a supervisor, and the Director of Clinical Services Camden Webb, LCSW, who oversees the program. The teams cover all six districts and a charter school for mental health issues.\nThe program elements are:\n\nNo insurance requirements\nServices are provided during school hours on school campuses\nThe only referral source is school sites\nProgram services dispatch and arrive within 30 minutes\nCoordinated with school personnel, law enforcement, and parent/caretaker\nContracted with Medic Ambulance for transport to CSU/Emergency Room when necessary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mobile crisis team operates a phone line and follows a crisis schedule. Once a call is received, they roll out within 30 minutes. The clinician completes a crisis assessment of the student using bhworks software. The intake form is embedded in the software. The staff bring laptops to collect electronic consents, go through the assessment, and establish a safety plan. The software also serves as an electronic health record to catalog the services provided. A service upload is then electronically shared with the county, and medical billing is generated without duplication to serve all levels of need across Solano’s six districts.\nIf the clinician determines what is needed is a safety plan, the student will be going home that day but will receive therapeutic counseling. If the student isn’t deemed safe, the program has contracted with a Medic Ambulance for transport to the emergency room.\n“We are going where the youth are – schools,” Webb explained. “We removed the barrier to access that is often tough for families. We are getting kids to a clinic during after school hours which is much more ideal for a crisis response.”\n\xa0\nTsunami of Need – the Data bhworks Collects\nIt was before the pandemic when SCOE submitted for the mobile crisis program funding, and at that time they projected handling 45 or 50 emergency responses in a school year.\n“Once the pandemic started, we knew a tsunami of need was coming,” said Webb.\nbhworks collects real-time data for SCOE programs. As of Feb. 7, 2022, the mobile crisis teams have\nmanaged 194 cases since August 2021; 91.5% for suicidal ideation; and 6.2% for homicidal ideation.\n“It’s the nature of the work. Making life and death decisions every day with a volume of youth needing to be seen,” Webb said. “It’s also why the staff can burn out. But, there is no doubt, we are saving kids’ lives.”\nOf those 194 cases, roughly 30% are students who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) and 8% are transgender.\n\xa0\nAmbulance instead of Police Car\n“What’s important is we get these kids into an ambulance instead of a police car. About 75% of the time we are safety planning and connecting them to a therapeutic counselor,” Webb said. The other 25% is a 5150 hold, referring to the California law code for the temporary commitment of those who present a danger to themselves or others due to signs of mental illness.\nWebb continued, “With this program, the students truly receive a plan and access to services. We are immediately giving them the help that they need; plus the process is more cost effective than previous efforts.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, they are not contracted to do follow up or outcome measures. Webb is anticipating the need to hire a paraprofessional – one that speaks Spanish – to handle case management with the schools and families after the response.\nWebb attributes Solano County’s school-wide Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) prevention model as the reason for their continued growth and improvements.\n“The foundation we established, the work we have done, has led us to where we are today,” he explained.\n\xa0\nNew California Law\nIn the future, Webb would like to see universal screening of students in all of the county’s K-12 schools, and SCOE has been working with the county’s behavioral health department to add even more comprehensive programming.\nThat has a good possibility of happening with a new California bill signed into law in July 2021 and currently being implemented. AB 133 California establishes the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative, which is being administered by the California Health and Human Services Agency. The initiative’s goal is to transform the state’s behavioral health system into “an innovative ecosystem in which all children, teenagers, and young adults 25 years of age and younger, regardless of payer, are screened, supported, and served for emerging and existing behavioral health needs.”\nIn addition, the State Department of Health Care Services will engage and oversee a vendor to establish and maintain a behavioral health services virtual platform [such as bhworks, Student Mental Health Software System from mdlogix] to integrate behavioral health screenings, application-based supports, and direct behavioral health services. The rest of California will follow Solano County’s lead if the bhworks software platform is chosen.\nSchools can do all the student behavioral screenings they want, but if there aren’t enough providers to meet the demand, treatment delays follow. So, the law calls for the supply of behavioral health counselors, coaches, peer supports, and other allied health care providers serving children and youth, including those at schoolsites, to expand.\n\xa0\nAbout SCOE\nSCOE offers key services and programs to six districts and 64,000 students, including:\n\nService and support to help districts meet legal mandates, operate cost-effectively, and raise student achievement\nFiscal oversight to districts\nSchools and services for special education and alternative education students who are notenrolled at district sites\nCollege and Career Readiness and Workforce Development Services\nProfessional development for teachers and administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Avenue 360 Health & Wellness to Use bhworks for Behavioral Health Care                \n', 'Description': '\nBaltimore, MD — Avenue 360 Health & Wellness in Houston, Texas, is the newest mdlogix client with seven of its clinical sites using our bhworks software platform for referral and care coordination, data collection, and population dashboard outcome measures. Avenue 360’s medical team provides primary, behavioral health, community wellness, housing, and dental care for patients at the beginning to the end of life, as well as operating a reduced-cost pharmacy.\nAvenue 360 received a five-year SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) grant from the federal government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to address behavioral health issues.\n“This $5 million initiative allows us to implement universal substance use screening for our patient population and conduct specialized interventions,” said Sondra Smith LCDC, who leads recovery support at Avenue 360. “The effort—unique in Houston’s community health system– comes as more people in the region are coping with the stressors brought by the pandemic. Utilizing the innovative bhworks software platform will help our care team respond quickly and effectively to minimize the negative health outcomes associated with substance use.”\nWith bhworks, Avenue 360 patients will self-report responses on any web-enabled device such as a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Results will be automatically scored, summarized, and ready for review by Avenue 360 clinicians. In addition to screening for multiple mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, trauma, substance misuse, and suicide ideation, the assessment identifies psychosocial risk factors, positive and negative, such as exposure to violence, including military service, family dynamic, and work/school activities.\nOnce a patient is screened and assessed, the bhworks software platform offers online consent, referrals, and care coordination, allows providers to communicate with patients via virtual visits, and securely collects data to see outcomes in real time. bhworks adheres to all data privacy and security measures (HIPAA compliant).\nThe Avenue 360 staff will fill out the GPRA-required (Government Performance and Results Act) National Outcomes Measures (NOMs) patient interview results directly in the bworks software platform, which automatically submits it to SPARS (the Performance Accountability and Reporting System) used by SAMHSA. This software process significantly reduces data reporting time and eliminates nearly all data errors.\nGPRA requires federal agencies to set specific near-term and long-term performance goals. Federal grantees, like Avenue 360, are required to collect and report NOMs data.\n“Data can be efficiently put into SPARS in real time with bhworks,” said Allen Tien, MD, MHS, mdlogix president and chief science officer. “We can help SAMHSA grantees, as well as grantees for other federal agencies, rapidly get data flowing with minimal errors to government reporting systems to meet their grant requirements.”\n# # #\nmdlogix, home of bhworks, designs software that combines science and practice.

The web-based platform from mdlogix has been offered to all 56 ISDs by the Michigan Department of Education to reduce youth suicides and to identify and address a range of mental health issues.\n“Our 31n counselors ‘played in the sandbox;’ practiced on the software so they were ready once we started using the system for real when the students returned,” Jennifer explained. “They were set up with assessments–which we did before on paper and pencil or through Google Docs—referrals, case notes, documentation, and Medicaid billing integration. It was a complete shift, but we launched it in late August.’”\nUp until this year BAISD only had two counselors for five school buildings. The District now has seven counselors to serve 13 different K-12 schools. In its entirety, BAISD encompasses seven local K-12 school districts (46 schools and approximately 14,900 students), all public, charter, parochial, and private schools. It is located in Bay City near the base of the Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron; in between the thumb and first index finger in the ‘mitten’ shape that is the lower part of Michigan.\nMichelle Goaley, BAISD Director of Instructional Services\nJennifer and the 31n counselors spent a half day in August with their participating schools defining the role of the 31n counselor, and the support services they would be providing. Each school spent time ‘Resource Mapping.’ This enabled teams to articulate the programs, people, services and resources that currently exist in their school. It allowed schools to define and gain a better understanding of when and how they would utilize the 31n counselor.\nMichelle said, “We identified each school’s community support services. Schools defined what staff would have access to bhworks, and who would be responsible for completing the referral.” Jennifer then visited each building individually to reinforce the process.\n“We are trying to keep each counselor’s caseload to around 40-45 students. Once we get some data from bhworks, it will guide us for placing future resources,” Jennifer added.\nBAISD has entered into a technical assistance agreement with Michigan Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MiMTSS). They are training all social workers and 31n counselors on foundational Functional Behavior Assessment-Behavior Intervention Plan (FBA/BIP) processes. This will allow these staff to become FBA/BIP trainers, who will in turn provide annual training for the ISD and districts. They are working to build the capacity and skill set of their 31n counselors, as they expect there to be more students with mental health needs in the upcoming year.\nEach 31n counselor has developed a Mental Health Support flyer which includes a QR code that can be scanned by students or families to reach out and request support from the counselor. Students and parents at the middle school and high school level have access to the flyer in order to reach out themselves. At the elementary level, parents have access. Michelle explained, “We want to make sure we recognize the needs of students. We want them to have the ability to reach out to ask for help in a variety of ways.”\nBecause the District adheres to the child study process, an intervention program that helps students who are struggling academically and/or behaviorally, and in which parents are fully involved, gaining parental consent has not been an issue. However, Jennifer is focused on the potential challenge of obtaining consent when it’s a crisis situation. At times, parents do not clearly understand the support being offered, or are in denial of the support needed.\nJennifer is glad they started preparing over the summer. “When the students returned, our schools were ready to go. They understood what the process was and how to do it. For other ISDs, my advice is that the referral process should be laid out in advance, when a student should be referred, and of course it should go through the child study process,” she said.\nMichelle concluded that over time, this work has expanded greatly. “As the district increased from two to seven counselors, the need for Jennifer’s role became more evident for managing the structure and systems for this to be successful. The process and system has to be strong and it has to have someone overseeing it. That’s Jennifer’s role. She coordinates and leads the behavioral health programs within each building in an effort to create and implement sustainable and impactful systems to support teaching and learning,” Michelle explained.\nLast year, Jennifer coordinated the 31n services for five schools, but with her expanded role and the bhworks software platform, she is optimistic about where the ISD and the support provided to local districts is headed.\n“We are moving forward in a way that will benefit our students,” Jennifer said. “Unfortunately, we don’t touch the needs yet of the whole ISD, but we will get there.”\nEditor’s Note: Jennifer Ayers can be reached at ayersj@baisd.net if other Michigan ISDs would like to discuss or ask questions about her experience in launching this system.\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        School-based Suicide Prevention: Promising Approaches and Opportunities for Research (Webinar)                \n', 'Description': '\nDate/Time:\xa0January 14, 2022,\xa02:00 – 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation:\xa0Virtual\nThis NIMH-hosted webinar will provide an opportunity for diverse stakeholders, including school administrators, researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and funders, to learn about new and innovative practices in school-based suicide prevention.\nThere will be a particular focus on identifying and supporting high-risk youth, as well as opportunities for evaluating these efforts.\nRegister for this Webinar\n\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Baltimore County Chooses bhworks Software for Opioid Preventions Efforts                \n', 'Description': '\nBaltimore, MD — The Baltimore County Department of Health (BCDH) in Maryland has chosen bhworks, the enterprise-scale behavioral health collaborative software platform from mdlogix, to support data and workflow aspects of their 4-year, Overdose to Action (OD2A) grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prevent opioid overdoses.\nThere were 561 opioid-related deaths in Baltimore County in the first quarter of 2020, of which over 93 percent were related to fentanyl.

In the first phase, nine Community Mental Health (CMH) organizations, including Sheppard Pratt, and associated providers have been contracted by PGCPS to provide services to students. There will be a standard electronic consent form, a consistent screening assessment – the Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and a standard referral workflow.\nOther Maryland counties should be able to use PGCPS’ procurement and software approach, greatly reducing delay and administrative effort for addressing urgent student needs. PGCPS is able to utilize other Public Entities contracts if three conditions apply. First, the contract has to be the result of a competitive solicitation. Second, the solicitation has to have a clause that allows for other entities to piggyback/ride the contract. Third, the contract has to be for the same services.

It is made possible with funding from the Michigan Health Endowment Fund.\nThanks to expanded funding, more Michigan schools are supporting their students’ mental and behavioral health. However, managing mental health support services for the hundreds or thousands of students enrolled in any of Michigan’s intermediate school districts (ISDs) is no simple task. That’s why the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) is making mdlogix bhworks behavioral health software available to all 56 of the state’s ISDs.\nThe software electronically manages and merges referrals, screenings, consent forms, assessments, treatment plans, and confidential communications among parents, teachers, and providers within one secure, HIPAA- and FERPA-compliant system. K–12 schools in 21 Michigan ISDs are already using the software to help therapists, counselors, and social workers streamline tasks and increase time spent actually seeing students. Another 10 Michigan ISDs are set to launch the software soon.\n“Our goal is to streamline the work as much as possible so we can maximize the providers’ time with kids,” says Diane Golzynski, director of the MDE Office of Health and Nutrition Services. “This software really is meant to help us get to that point.”\nWhen Scott Hutchins joined Golzynski as school mental health and Medicaid consultant for the Office of Health and Nutrition Services in 2020, he began fielding a lot of questions from ISDs about how they ought to implement mental health supports in their schools. He discovered that they lacked a consistent way to organize referrals, utilize assessments, and share information. The bhworks platform helps providers serving the state’s students to save time, work more effectively, follow evidence-based standards, and leverage best practices. The platform is designed to address students with depression, trauma, anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders — and reduce risks for self-harm, violence, and suicide.\n“They were spending a lot of time really not doing what they were intending to do, which is providing direct services to students,” Hutchins says. “They had a lot of ancillary things. We wanted to find a platform that would streamline best practices for standard operating procedures.”\nBuilding a better system\nCopper Country ISD (CCISD) was the first ISD to pilot the software. CCISD oversees schools across a huge geographic area in the northern tip of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula — Houghton, Baraga, and Keweenaw counties — serving approximately 6,600 students in 14 local school districts: nine K-12, one K-8, and four K-6 districts. With CCISD’s feedback, mdlogix tweaked the software to better meet Michigan schools’ needs.\n“We wanted a central referral system and a way we can keep all of the information in one area,” says Natalie Morgan, CCISD mental health services coordinator. “We did have a spreadsheet to keep track of paper referrals that schools had to fax to an office. Sometimes, some of those fax machines were not working. Also, consent papers get lost when students take them home for parent permission signatures.”\nCCISD assigns each of its mental health therapists to only two or three schools. This allows them to build relationships with their schools’ administrators and determine the best ways to service students in the school. Because CCISD covers such a large area, this also reduces what Morgan calls “windshield time.” She believes bhworks software will reduce it even more.\n“This past summer we were able to do [a social-emotional learning] screener with some students in a summer school program that helps us to gather information and have it all in one spot,” Morgan says. “We want to do that with more classrooms and more schools to get a baseline idea where students are with social-emotional learning.”\nCCISD plans to use the software to facilitate more mental health screenings with individual students, classrooms, and even entire grade levels.\n“If you use a screener that’s within bhworks, it’s automatically scored and sent back to the provider or the administrator,” Morgan says. “They’re going to get immediate scores back that says this student is indicating high for depression or anxiety, or the student has indicated substance use disorder, or possible suicide ideation. So again, instead of waiting long periods of time … all of that is instantaneous, as soon as that child hits ‘submit’ on the screener.”\nAnd, when screenings indicate an issue, referrals are made much more quickly. Hutchins says that before bhworks was implemented, “everybody was doing something different” for referrals. Referrals might be in the form of an email, a Google form, a fax, or a phone call.\n“bhworks allows everybody to have a consistent referral process,” he says. “Now they are starting to see students within 24 hours of a referral when before it could be days, if not weeks. … Now we’re talking almost immediate treatment for these most vulnerable students, which is just again a complete game-changer for our ISDs.”\nThe software also allows mental health providers to initiate virtual telehealth visits with students, overcoming another common challenge for ISDs.\n“This feature allows students and providers to still meet if the student is absent from school or the provider is unable to be at the same physical location as the student,” Hutchins says. “This has been utilized often by ISDs when students or staff have had to be quarantined for COVID protocols, and also to continue services for some students over the summer when school was not in session.”\n“This is about the future of Michigan’s kids”\nAccording to a brief by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, one of every six students copes with a mental illness that increases likelihood of school absences, suspensions, expulsions, and academic failures. Even before COVID-19 impacted mental health across the board, 17% of U.S. students in grades nine through 12 seriously considered attempting suicide. Only one-third of adolescents with mental illness go on to post-secondary education. On the bright side, the brief says, “early detection of mental health concerns leads to improved academic achievement and reduced disruptions at school.”\n“If we haven’t taken care of the basic needs of that student, so that they feel safe and secure and wanted in that space, they’ll never learn to their potential,” Golzynksi says. “This is about the future of Michigan’s kids. And if we believe in Michigan’s future, we have to give the kids the best possible chance that we can.”\nAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, COVID-19’s impacts on Michiganders’ mental health are extensive and have the potential to impact large swaths of the Michigan population, including children. The ultimate goal of implementing the bhworks software throughout Michigan’s ISDs is to help those children overcome those challenges, do well in school, and succeed as adults.\n“It’s our job to help students to learn how to cope and manage their feelings. Bringing awareness and making mental health a lot less stigmatizing is one of the important parts, too, as well as letting students know that there are people that they can talk to, open up to, that there are adults that care about them,” Morgan says. “Studies have shown that students [getting mental health care] are more likely to attend school regularly and get better grades. For some students, the home environment is not where they can get that support. So being able to provide that at school is just essential to their overall well-being.”\nA freelance writer and editor, Estelle Slootmaker is happiest writing about social justice, wellness, and the arts.

The screened students are being connected with a range of supports and services of varying intensity to meet the range of needs they may present with.\n“Understanding student mental health, the behavioral health screen, and talking about early identification and early intervention, that was always an easy conversation with our board,” said Stephen Sharp, the District’s K-12 school counselor coordinator and the Landisville Middle School Grade 8 school counselor. He was named Middle School Counselor of the Year by the Pennsylvania School Counselors Association in 2017-2018.\nThe District is near Lancaster, Pa., home of the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Amish Mennonite groups and situated southeast of Harrisburg, the capital of the state. There are 10 public schools serving 6,800 students.\nFor years they have been addressing the student mental health needs targeted at eighth and 10th graders. Hempfield previously used the Columbia University TeenScreen Program, a national mental health and suicide risk screening initiative for middle- and high-school age adolescents, before the program ended in 2012.\n“Those identified with active suicide ideation was pretty consistent, at about 4 percent,” Steve explained. “With that being said, anxiety or stress was growing at a pace that was concerning, 30-34%; consistent with state and national data and pre-pandemic.”\nTwo Options for Screening.The District now has in-person schooling, with an online option which existed pre- pandemic for those in need. Screening for sixth – 12th grade students will start at the end of September to allow referral seats to get caught up from the summer, before the next set of youth are identified. As for parental consent, it is currently opt in, but the District is aiming to transition to a passive permission.\n“The staff choose between two different screening event models,” Steve said. “One is a cohort model when counselors do screenings over a 3-week period and the other is a large group screening done all in one swoop.” Most choose the large group screening.\nScreening is done once during the school year, but Steve would like to do it more often, continuing to monitor and track trends.\nUninsured and LimitedLike many other school districts, one of the biggest barriers is insurance coverage for minorities and access to care. Once the students are identified with needs, the challenge is getting the care and paying for it.\n\xa0“Referral volume is absolutely one of the key pieces we need to fix,” Steve said. “We haven’t been able to meet the need as we try to support and mitigate the problems students are having. In a recent study, in partnership with a local university, we found over 36% of behavioral health providers either waitlist or are not taking new patients throughout May. We’re concerned this will carry throughout the 21-22 school year. It’s definitely strained.”\nIt’s an ongoing challenge they are working to address. The District has a unique partnership with its community behavioral health agency to streamline its outpatient therapy. “We’ve worked hard to identify the range of services they offer, and allow the school staff, in partnership with families, refer directly to school-based therapy, outpatient therapies, psychiatric services, and more,” Steve described.\nbhworks Software PlatformHSD has been using bhworks, a comprehensive, validated software platform with its Behavioral Health Screen (BHS), for several years now.\n“The biggest thing for me as I talk with my staff is that with a reasonable investment of time, we have the ability to do the scheduling; we understand and control the data; we read the screening reports; we control the workflow; and we have an alignment in the communication with necessary staff,” Steve pointed out. “I like that. That component is working, and we now have more time to concentrate on connecting the identified students to the services they need.”\nEditor’s Note: Steve Sharp can be reached at stephen_sharp@hempfieldsd.org to discuss his experience with other school districts.\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Kansas Trainings Teach Emotional Coping Strategies Following Disasters                \n', 'Description': '\nTwo Kansas mental health advocacy, education, and support organizations are offering 15 virtual or in-person training programs to parents, caregivers, school staff, K-12 students, and community organizations in 70 counties to help them cope with the mental impact of experiencing and surviving a natural disaster.\xa0Outreach and service provision for the program, known as “Strong Communities for Trying Times,” is shared by the Mental Health Association of South Central Kansas (MHASCK) and Mental Health America of the Heartland (MHAH).\n“While the federal grant we received was not initially designed to address the “disaster” of the pandemic, the need for clear information, strategies to cope with disasters of all types, and ways to build resilience in the face of difficulty, has only increased due to COVID-19,” Susan Lewis, MSSW, MHAH president/CEO said. “The need for and impact of these sessions is profound, and we are pleased at the partnerships that have enabled these services to be delivered in our communities.”\nKay Burnett, MHASCK director of prevention and monitoring, explained, “Our goal is to help participants identify mental health resources available in their community and to help them feel more comfortable seeking help if needed.”\nbhworks, the comprehensive, validated software platform from mdlogix, is the technology that establishes online training registration, generates new pre- and post- evaluation forms, collects and stores those responses, and produces a certificate of completion.\nThe Kansas Department of Aging & Disabilities Services (KDADS) worked with Drexel University’s Center for Family Intervention Science and the two MHAs last August to write and submit an application for a federal disaster relief grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The one-year funding was awarded in September 2020. The project is focused on improving the mental health of children and adolescents affected by natural disasters in 2019, including tornados and flooding. These weather events created damage in 70 of 105 Kansas counties, most of which exist in rural or frontier areas.\nProgram activities are supporting the development and implementation of a school- based comprehensive plan of strategies that provide training, education and technology to school districts, mental health providers, and community members.\nTraining course descriptions and schedules are posted on the newly-established website, the Behavioral Health Learning Collaborative (BHLC) of Kansas, bhlcofks.org. Burnett said popular school sessions in her region include “Positive Minds” for 4th and 5th graders and high school students, which helps them mentally deal with difficult issues. For adults, such as teachers and parents, a popular session is “Disorders, Not Bad Behaviors,” which helps people identify what is a typical behavior or normal response to a disaster versus a mental health disorder in children and teens.\nIn the Heartland region, “Positive Minds” is popular among middle and high schoolers, as is “A.N.S.W.E.R.” (Adolescents Never Suicide When Everyone Responds), which focuses on depression, anxiety and suicide and promotes help seeking. “QPR” (Question, Persuade, Respond), which focuses on suicide prevention, has been particularly popular among school staff in that same region.\nMHA staff contact schools, community organizations like the Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls Clubs, and nonprofits. The two MHAs meet twice a month to compare notes and share updates. The curriculum each MHA provides mirrors the other, conducting the same training sessions and issuing the same evaluation forms.\nOutreach starts with an email and after a week they follow up with either a phone call or email. On the third attempt, they either call or send a letter. Burnett suggests patience in outreach efforts as it takes fostering relationships to get responses, and to be cognizant of how often you are contacting them.\n“We have stretched our community outreach to include sites that we had not previously considered, including domestic violence shelters, rehabilitation centers, foster care sites, and colleges and tech schools,” Burnett said. “These are groups that weren’t initially on our radar but they have been extremely receptive.”\nPopular sessions with community groups are “QPR” and “More than Sad,” a course that teaches adults how to manage teen depression and anxiety.\nWith bhworks, participants are able to register for training and complete an evaluation for each session. There are approximately 10 questions on the assessment forms, asking, for example, “Are you more likely to seek help now that you have completed this session?”\nBecause of their age, kindergarten to 3rd grade students do not complete evaluations.\nThe program has encountered some challenges since its inception as COVID restrictions and on-line schooling at times complicated outreach and scheduling.\nLewis noted, “The staff of both MHAs are to be commended on their persistence, creativity, and flexibility, as well as their commitment to do whatever it takes to get this important information to our parents, teachers, kids and communities.”\n“I do believe it’s working. It’s great we are able to do things virtually, but technology can present challenges,” Burnett added. “WiFi can be unreliable, kids turn their camera off, or the audio isn’t clear when participants are in a big room. Providing the courses in person is ideal because we can better gauge learning.”\nDespite challenges, the MHAs of Kansas set a goal for the two regions to train 1,250 people each by the end of October 2021. As of August 10, that goal was exceeded and more than 2,800 people have taken a training session.\nKDADS requested a 9-month, no-cost extension of the SAMHSA grant, which ends in October 2021, to finish work that is underway. The request was recently accepted and now the grant will extend through June 30, 2022.\nTo learn more about the Kansas training program and its various sessions, please\ncontact Kay Burnett at Kburnett@mhasck.org or Stacy Davis at sdavis@mhah.org.\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Copper Country School District conducts ‘Super Smooth’ SEL universal screening event using bhworks                \n', 'Description': '\nMichigan’s Department of Education chose in May the bhworks software platform from mdlogix to help schools statewide to gain consent, screen, identify, assess, refer, and monitor treatment for all school-age youth grades K–12.

The program consists of three schools: Hancock Elementary, Chassell Elementary, and Lake Linden-Hubbell public schools.\n“It went super smooth,” said Natalie Morgan, LMSW, mental health services coordinator, CCISD. “There were no system glitches, and at one point we were screening 12 students at once. Our time was limited in the morning school schedule, but we got it done.”\nbhworks is one of the leading statewide behavioral mental health platforms providing end to end functionality, including system integration and Medicaid billing. It is fulfilling the needs of Michigan ISDs by integrating with existing systems, such as EDPlan, MiDataHub, CompuClaim, and others, to ensure there is no duplication of effort.\nThe system is HIPAA and FERPA compliant and mdlogix is currently going through the state security certification process for bhworks which will be completed in September.\nbhworks can be accessed from any web-enabled device, providing organizations with the tools they need to deliver behavioral health services anywhere people live, work, study, or receive care. The comprehensive software allows school districts in this case\xa0to obtain consents and screen whole populations with high efficiency and reliability,\xa0help with SEL assessments, offer referrals, communicate via telehealth visits, and securely collect data to see outcomes in real time and adjust resources as needed. It can enhance Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) programs in structure, process, and outcomes aspects.\nNatalie explained that they set up in a school computer lab and brought 34 students from kindergarten to 5th grade over an hour and a half period to conduct the online screening and assessment, and then generate reports. Natalie retrieved the students from classrooms and brought them to the computer lab where three additional staff signed the students in. They read the survey to kindergartners and first grade students, while most of the second grade students could read it themselves. Third, fourth and fifth graders were included.\nA data dashboard covering core competencies for this event was generated and is being analyzed by CCISD leaders.\n“The overall process using bhworks went very well and the ease of use was greatly appreciated. We are looking forward to using this process for additional districts as students start returning to school,” Natalie said.\n“After completion of this process, I was contacted by the Hancock Public Schools superintendent and he requested the data be presented at a school-wide professional development day so it can be used to create appropriate SEL lessons for different grade levels,” added Natalie.\nEditor’s Note: For more information about Copper Country’s youth mental\xa0health program with bhworks, email Natalie Morgan at nmorgan@copperisd.org.\nIf you or your ISD is interested in bringing bhworks to your school(s), please\xa0contact Scott Hutchins, School Mental Health and Medicaid consultant, MDE\xa0Office of Health and Nutrition Services at HutchinsS1@michigan.gov or\xa0517-241-7099.\n\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Veterans group, dedicated to stopping suicides, using bhworks mental health software platform                \n', 'Description': '\nBaltimore, MD — Valhalla Veteran’s Services, which provides services to over 26,000 veterans and first responders covering three Pennsylvania counties, is now using the bhworks mental health software platform from mdlogix to stop suicides.\n“I have lost eight comrades to suicide over the last 20 years,” said Eric Darling, executive director, Valhalla Veteran’s Services, Inc., and an Army retiree. “Unfortunately, for many veterans, the option of suicide is more palatable than facing failure.

The District supports close to 12,000 students in 10 elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 5), three middle schools (grades 6 through 8), and three high schools (grades 9 through 12). It also provides services to nearly 4,000 non-public school students. They have 950 teachers, 60 administrators and 400 support staff.\n“We were seeing so many more mental health issues; high anxiety, crying, and suicidal ideation,” Carol explained. “As the staff was reporting on this, we needed the data to back it up and set a plan in motion to address it.”\nThe Pennsylvania Youth Survey (PAYS) began in 1989 and is given every other year starting in the 6th grade to gather information about youth knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. West Chester confirmed what the District was facing.\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=”4.4.2″ custom_padding=”0px||16px|||”][et_pb_column type=”4_4″ _builder_version=”4.4.2″][et_pb_text _builder_version=”4.4.2″ custom_margin=”-20px|||||” hover_enabled=”0″ min_height=”153px”]\n\xa0\nPutting their House in Order\n“Students were feeling hopeless; feeling worthless most every day. The number of occurrences was huge. Our kids were not coping well,” Carol disclosed. “Yet, even though we got that data, it’s anonymous. We didn’t know who they were, and before we began to identify and treat them, we had to first start putting our house in order. We needed to get services and resources ready.”\nThey evaluated all of their teams – MTSS (multi-tiered system of supports), SAP (student assistance program), pupil services – and their administrative resources. They needed additional staff, more training, and better technology to pull it all together.\nCarol heard about bhworks, a comprehensive, validated software platform powered by mdlogix, at a conference five years ago. The web-based platform can be used for obtaining consents, universal or indicated screening, social emotional learning (SEL) assessment, referrals, care coordination, storing and sharing case notes, real-time site and population data analytics, telehealth/virtual care, and integration with existing systems. It is HIPAA and FERPA compliant.\nIn spring 2017, she applied for and received an annual Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) that enabled the District to start using bhworks and to add three mental health specialists to each of their middle schools. She trained all the counselors, case workers, mental health specialists and in the first year, offered a universal screen for 7th and 8th graders in three schools; two days in each school.\nBefore, when the SAP teams got referrals, they were very general – sleeping in class, missing homework deadlines and sometimes they weren’t really sure what was going on with that student. The team would guess at what the primary concern was and that process was inefficient. With screening, the team got a good idea of a direction and closely identified what was going on, and then they were able to provide targeted and effective interventions and resources immediately to students and parents. The chances are greater in getting the students the support that is needed in order to be academically successful.\n“The fear with universal screening is…OMG we are going to identify so many kids we won’t be able to handle all of them,” Carol noted. “There aren’t as many as you think there will be, and there are degrees of concerns. You need to make sure you handle the more serious cases that day.”\n\xa0Identifying Kids with Mental Health Issues\n“Pick one super-organized person to prepare and organize the screenings,” Carol disclosed. “You also need someone to navigate the technology. If you do that work, the screening days go well.”\nThey had their team run through scenarios in advance of the screening days to identify and fix any kinks in the process. It takes approximately 15 minutes for each screen, so West Chester can handle 20 to 25 kids in one class period.\nCarol explained, “You need to be on your game. Once you have it though, you run through it, and it’s very effective. This screening helps the team determine what’s going on with the students and give them the best possible intervention.”\nEach year she re-applied for the grant and at the end of the three-year grant cycle, she put money in the school budget to expand their use of bhworks. Also by then, the school district grew to having nine mental health specialists. During the COVID pandemic last year, the platform’s telehealth feature enabled the mental health specialists to meet virtually with students in need.\nProgress Monitoring\nCarol described another critical piece of bhworks, progress monitoring. “We do that easily for math and for reading but always found it hard to monitor mental health.”\nBhworks helps manage the risks for multiple domains including self harm, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, substance use and depression. Carol elaborated, “Now you have something to compare to: Are they less anxious? Are they more resilient? The true beauty of this screening is that we identified those kids that internalize; that blend into the classroom and you would never know what they were going through. They had suicidal thoughts and we never knew it until we did universal screening. It’s a great tool to identify kids in need.”\nNow every student who goes through MTSS and the team believes there is a mental health concern the bhworks screen is given to offer a good base line.\nCarol is grateful she works in a district with a superintendent, Dr. James Scanlon and a director of pupil services, Dr. Leigh Ann Ranieri, who are supportive, and in a county rich with resources. By fall, they will have 12 mental health specialists. She will be retiring this summer and knows she is handing off to her successor an invaluable program.\n“With all the varied difficulties we all have experienced in the past 16 months, the WCASD plans to use the universal screening as a way to identify the concerns of our students and implement MTSS Tier 1, 2, and 3 to meet their needs,” Carol concluded. “This hopefully will get our students back to a more ‘normal’ school year.”\nEditor’s Note: If you are interested in contacting West Chester Area School District to discuss these efforts, please email Steve Werner, assistant director of pupil services, at swerner@wcasd.k12.pa.us\n\n\xa0\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        We R H.O.P.E chooses BH-Works behavioral health software for Vermont public schools and one New Hampshire school                \n', 'Description': '\nBaltimore, MD — We R H.O.P.E has contracted to use bhworks, the comprehensive, validated, behavioral health software platform from mdlogix, to help eight Vermont schools and one New Hampshire school to gain consent, screen, identify, assess, refer, and monitor treatment for the students.

The District is located southeast of Harrisburg, the state capital, and educates over 3,600 students in grades K-12. It never had a social worker on staff. Kirsten asked what were their expectations for the position and what were the latest student needs assessments?\n“I remembered the interview panel looking around at each other and the response being, ‘we don’t know, but we know we need a social worker to get us started,’” recalled Kirsten, who has a child welfare background. “Prior to my joining the district, we were missing early identification of student needs. We weren’t screening for behavioral health or social emotional competencies. My job was to find a holistic mechanism to identify children in need.”\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was finishing up its third year of the Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and allowed DASD to join. That enabled them to pilot bhworks, the comprehensive, validated software platform powered by mdlogix, and confirm what it could do.\nThe web-based platform can be used for obtaining consents, universal or indicated screening, social emotional learning (SEL) assessment, referrals, care coordination,\nstoring and sharing case notes, real-time site and population data analytics, telehealth/ virtual care, and integration with existing systems. It is HIPAA and FERPA compliant.\n“We were quickly sold,” Kirsten explained. “The system’s Behavioral Health Screen [BHS] identified multiple students who were currently experiencing suicidal ideation, as well as a myriad of other mental health needs. As a district that participated in the Pennsylvania Youth Survey, we knew aggregately that there were significant needs in the district. This tool helped us find the individual students so that we could offer support and intervene.”\nOnce DASD was finished with the grant in 2018 – 2019, they hired a second social worker and paid for bhworks to continue. The district expanded into universal screening\xa0and progress monitoring. They decided to let the parents opt out of their child being\xa0screened instead of agreeing or opting in.\nThe District chose to screen Grades 7 and 9 because those were grade levels that were new to buildings, and if mental health issues are going to surface, they frequently do so around the start of puberty. Only about 15 of the 600 students in those two grades chose not to participate.\n“This generation and their willingness to use technology to communicate is very different from what they would ever convey in person to an adult,” Kirsten said. The District emphasized and repeated the message that students’ mental health is as important as their academic success.\nIn-Person Schooling During Pandemic\nDover remained open for in-school learning during the 2020 pandemic, and parents were grateful for the screening opportunity to ‘take the mental health temperature’ of their kids.\nKirsten said, “I am exceptionally proud of how the District fared [with respect to COVID cases]. We operated safely and did not see a community spread.”\nHowever, as they reintegrated into school in fall 2020, the transition from the long quarantine wasn’t smooth for the students. What DASD experienced was a student\nuptick in anxiety; more debilitating than they had ever seen before, with significant internalizing symptoms.\nProvider Challenge\n“Globally, we are well aware we are in a mental health crisis,” Kirsten expressed. Plus, while they have a school-based therapy provider who is a huge asset to the community, any need beyond outpatient is stymied. There are no in-home providers and psychiatric access is at least 45 days. The two social workers and the therapy provider try to fill the gaps.\nThe use of bhworks as a tool for school counselors who are not trained in mental health and schools without social workers, allows them to at least quickly and accurately conduct needs assessments.\nExpanding to More Students\nEven with the provider challenge, Kirsten explained it’s critical to move to an even larger\xa0scale this coming school year. Come September, every student from Grades 6 – 12 who\xa0visits his/her/their school counselor will get a behavioral health screen.\n“Kudos to this system,” said Kirsten. “It has altered how we meet the needs of students. It’s providing important data, communicating at a universal level the integration between mental health and academic success, and is allowing us to move our efforts forward in social and emotional learning. The use of the tool conveys the importance of student mental health in partnership with families, and is working with us to reduce the stigma of these ever prevalent challenges.”\nEditor’s Note: Please contact Kirsten Johnson, kjohnson@doversd.org for more\ninformation.\n'}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        Successful Start in Kansas with Youth Universal Mental Health Screening and Coping Strategies                \n', 'Description': '\nMay is Mental Health Awareness month and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disabilities Services (KDADS), mdlogix client, is diligently working with schools to improve the mental health of children and adolescents.\nThe Kansas Behavioral Health Integration into Schools (BHIS) program uses bhworks, a comprehensive, secure, validated, end-to-end software platform powered by mdlogix, to support the development, implementation and continuous improvement of a school-based plan of strategies that will provide training, education and technology to school districts, mental health providers and community members. The program is funded through a federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\nLast week, a local Kansas high school allowed 9th and 10th graders to volunteer, with parental consent, to be confidentially screened for such issues as significant stress, anxiety, body image, depression and suicidal thoughts. More than 30 percent of the students participated, and three clinicians were on hand to discuss the screening results, coping mechanisms and continuing treatment if warranted. The bhworks software platform, accessible from any web-enabled device, is compliant with all federal security standards (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\nStaff at Mirror, Inc. a non-profit private corporation providing behavioral health care, alcohol and drug use prevention services in Kansas, created and disseminated a video to obtain parental consent a month ahead of the day when services were offered in a reserved school room.\n“We want to normalize checking on a student’s mental health,” said Cody Beaton, LSCSW, LCAC, South Central Kansas regional director for Mirror, Inc. “Parents don’tquestion the need to consent for a physical for their child to play school sports. A mental\xa0health checkup should be the same. Kids are under stress with parental expectations\xa0and school demands along with a year of COVID upending life as they knew it.”\n“Parents were grateful for the service, and the kids openly talked about their mental health,” Beaton said. “The smoothest part was the technology, bhworks. Each student had a computer, so we sent them a link to complete the questions. They breezed right through it, and we could read the results in real time. That’s when the counselors could privately speak with them about coping mechanisms if their anxiety rated high, for example.”\nParents who declined their child’s participation cited privacy concerns.\n“I cannot stress enough that a student’s medical information is confidential and will not be shared,” said Linda Buchheister, KDADS System of Care project director. “In fact, it would be a violation of the law for the school and its counselors to do so.”\nThe BHIS program is run by an interdisciplinary project team that includes faculty and staff from Drexel University’s Center for Family Intervention Science, Mental Health America (MHA) of the Heartland and the Mental Health Association (MHA) of South Central Kansas. Go to BHLCofks.org for information about conducting this assessment resource in your school.\nYouth are the most effective agent of change when it comes to impacting other youth. KDADS is also working with Mirror to expand Youth Leadership in Kansas (YLINK). This model is rooted in prevention science and builds in protective factors that buffer kids from risk and promotes resilience. Through YLINK, teens are empowered to impact their school and community in a positive way by reducing substance use, promoting mental health and building hope and connection. Peer leaders connect through YLINK with like-minded peers in their hometown and beyond. For more information about YLINK, please contact Douglas.Bowman2@ks.gov.\nAre you a Kansas K-12 school, student, local education agency, community mental health center (CMHC) or a school-based mental health service provider that wants to participate in either of these programs?

The goal is toreduce youth suicides and other mental health issues, as well as streamline confidential communication among parents, teachers, and providers. bhworks is being offered for use in all 56 Intermediate School Districts (ISDs), potentially reaching 1.5 million students. “Our plan has been to give each student who needs help the opportunity to express their feelings with no judgment or stigma, to do so in a statewide coordinated effort, and to offer the best care and monitor local and state outcomes,” said Diane Golzynski, PhD, RD, director, Office of Health and Nutrition Services, Michigan Department of Education. “By implementing this technology infrastructure, we advance the vision the department, state legislators, educators, and health providers made as a youth priority prior to COVID, and which is now even more critical. Michigan can help guide other states that need a defined, collaborative process with their schools as the foundation and the software management platform to carry all of it out.” Psychiatrist Allen Tien, MD, MHS, mdlogix president and chief science officer said, “Our bhworks platform will enable Michigan providers to save time, work more effectively, collectively follow evidence-based standards, and leverage best practices. Given the rising rate of youth depression, anxiety and suicides, it is a model that should be replicated in schools across the country.”\nBH-Works allows school districts to obtain consents and screen whole populations with high efficiency and reliability, help with Social Emotional Learning (SEL) assessments, offer referrals, communicate via virtual visits, and securely collect data to see outcomes in real time and adjust resources as needed. It can alsoenhance Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) programs. bhworks is one of the leading statewide behavioral mental health platforms. mdlogix is working at the federal and state government levels to make its collaborative solution a national one. The platform software tools adhere to all data security measures (HIPAA and FERPA compliant). “Our technology is the infrastructure for a network of people working to reduce depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicides, and other behavioral issues,” Dr. Tien said. “We as a company bring science, public health, engineering, and solutions-driven client relations to any project. We work as collaborators with school psychologists, school counselors, school social workers, school nurses, pediatricians, educators, community mental health professionals and more, to make a dramatic difference in behavioral mental health by disrupting the usual dysfunctional communications silos and using technological innovation.”]\nmdlogix and its statewide school-based clients have also formed Behavioral Health Learning Collaboratives (BHLC). We are committed to sharing best practices, as well as technology, training, and other resources to improve mental health programs. To learn more, go to BHLCofmi.org and BHLCofpa.org. Pennsylvania has been using bhworks for more than 10 years. In that time, over 4,800 students were found to have suicide ideation, 31,521 had moderate or severe signs of depression, and close to 30,000 showed signs of anxiety. They were then given access to the appropriate services and monitored. Join us.

During her tenure in Pennsylvania, we established the BHLC to support the Student Assistance Program, a state-wide school-based mental health screening and assessment program. Based at Drexel University in collaboration with the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, the BHLC supports providers across the state in the identification and referral of youth in schools who might need mental health services.\nMental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicide ideation have dramatically increased among youth during COVID. Behavioral health programming can be improved in every state with a BHLC by creating shared resources, procedures and vision about health care coordination. Through multiple collaborations and grants, a network of stakeholders from emergency departments, schools, primary care practices, community-based organizations, behavioral health clinics, families, and individuals can come to learn and support one another.\n“We have screened over 100,000 youth in Pennsylvania and identified over 4,600 people with suicide ideation since we started using this model,” said Guy Diamond, Ph.D., director, Center for Family Intervention Science at Drexel University and BHLC co-director along with Tita Atte, M.P.H., C.P.H. “This network has helped disseminate best practices and high-quality research that has greatly benefitted Pennsylvania, and could be a resource in all 50 states.”\nBHLC participants all share the same web-based behavioral health screening system which standardizes data across the state. It offers evidence-based and validated comprehensive screening, tracking, and outcomes measurement. The program also serves as a learning community to help overcome challenges in this time of COVID (e.g. moving to telehealth). The BHLC model is expanding to California, Kansas and Michigan thus serving as a national model for improving quality and coordination of mental health services.\nNick Jaskiw, \xa0Michigan Association of School Psychologists president said, “We see such potential in this BHLC model in identifying students at risk, in saving young lives, and in developing a community of practice that will help change the mental health culture of Michigan.Our state is currently working to launch the BHLC of Michigan in just a few months.”\nDr. Diamond concluded, “I congratulate Dr. Levine on her nomination and hope we can assist her in her mission to improve health care across the nation.”# # #\nBHLCs are powered by BH-Works, a software platform that can be accessed from any web-enabled device, providing organizations with the tools they need to deliver behavioral health services anywhere people live, work, study, or receive care.\xa0\n\xa0 '}, {'Title': '\n\r\n                                        mdlogix partners with PRO Health Group to create app to support patients with OUD                \n', 'Description': '\nWe are pleased to announce that Dr. Allen Tien, President & Chief Science Officer at mdlogix, has been awarded a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

Dr. Proctor has extensive experience developing and implementing addictions outcomes monitoring systems for numerous treatment agencies, including opioid treatment clinics.\nThe 12-month grant will support development and evaluation of the “PROCare” platform, which aims to improve outcomes for people struggling with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The platform will provide both a patient-facing app and provider-facing dashboard. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to test the preliminary effectiveness of PROCare among a sample of patients receiving addiction treatment through Thriving Mind South Florida in Miami. Dr. John Newcomer, President and CEO of Thriving Mind South Florida, will serve on the Advisory Board for the project.\xa0\xa0\nPROCare’s patient-facing app will incentivize participants to complete tasks that could improve their chances of long-term recovery.\xa0 These tasks could include daily check-ins to gauge cravings and motivation, participation in educational activities, or routine surveys to assess healthcare utilization, behavioral health & social determinants status, medication adherence, and occupational functioning. When patients complete tasks on the app, they will receive credits that can be redeemed for monetary and non-monetary rewards.
