[{'Title': 'Wesana Health Outlines Accelerated Drug Development Pathway', 'Description': '\nCHICAGO and TORONTO, May 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —\xa0Wesana Health Holdings Inc.\xa0(“Wesana” or the “Company”) (CSE: WESA; OTCQB: WSNAF),\xa0a data-driven life sciences company focused on developing the novel therapies of tomorrow and delivering new care paradigms today, is pleased to announce that following the completion of a successful Pre-IND meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Company is expanding its lead indication for SANA-013 to Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) and exploring other complementary orphan indications.\nConsistent with the positive feedback received from FDA, Wesana will accelerate the development of SANA-013 by initiating a Phase 1b/2a human study for MDD in H1 2023. In contrast to the prior development pathway for SANA-013 with TBI associated depression as the lead indication, the revised development pathway would allow the Company to bypass the healthy patient population study and research an MDD affected patient population directly as part of a Phase 1b/2a study.\nWesana’s SANA-013 is designed to deliver a novel depression treatment protocol that includes a single high dose of psilocybin followed by a maintenance regimen of a non-hallucinogenic dose of psilocybin combined with cannabidiol (CBD). The low, non-hallucinogenic dose of psilocybin in combination with CBD is being developed for MDD and other indications so that affected people can benefit from a chronic, at-home use proposition.\nDaniel Carcillo, Wesana’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Given the positive written feedback from FDA regarding SANA-013, we are extremely excited to begin developing meaningful clinical data for our novel formulation and protocol. We believe SANA-013 provides Wesana distinct advantages compared to other companies exploring psilocybin, as they are primarily focused on delivering large in-clinic doses of psilocybin on an intermittent basis and therefore are not optimally positioned to treat conditions such as MDD that likely will require some kind of chronic dosing.”\nMDD is a chronic, recurring, and debilitating mental disorder leading it to be one of the most burdensome illnesses on a global scale. Patients suffering from MDD are frequently and significantly impaired from an occupational and social function standpoint resulting in severe economic costs. With approximately 264 million people suffering from depression globally, according to World Health Organization data in 2020, the market size is currently estimated to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% to US$16 billion by 2026.1\nAbout Wesana Health\nWesana\xa0Health\xa0helps people transcend barriers in mental health and performance.\xa0We innovate in care development through our therapies and patent-pending\xa0protocols, and in care delivery through activating a new multidisciplinary, technology-supported clinical model.

The Company believes the written response provides a path to agreements on IND-enabling studies and validates the team’s effort and accomplishments over the past year. Wesana intends to initiate its in-human clinical study program in late 2022. The FDA response also provided important insights pertaining to advancing SANA-013 as a potential treatment for TBI-related MDD.\nMark A. Wingertzahn, Wesana’s Chief Scientific Officer\xa0said, “We are highly appreciative of the clear direction FDA has given us in terms of what will be required to advance SANA-013. We look forward to commencing our clinical development program with their feedback in mind and in full compliance with FDA drug development guidelines.”\nSANA-013 is covered under patent applications owned by Wesana and directed to novel composition and novel methods of use. Patent applications detail the use of a loading dose of psilocybin and a maintenance dose of psilocybin given concomitantly with a dose of cannabidiol (“CBD”). This novel combination therapy has demonstrated effectiveness through different and potentially complementary pharmacologic pathways. Unlike therapist assisted, single dose therapy, where a large dose of psilocybin is administered in clinic, which has exhibited poor durability and waning effects beginning as early as a few weeks post administration, SANA-013 is being developed to utilize a loading dose of psilocybin followed by self-administered maintenance doses of psilocybin and CBD to provide more sustained effects and benefit over time.\n“We were pleased with the feedback from the FDA regarding SANA-013,” said Wesana founder and CEO, Daniel Carcillo. “This is the most important work of my lifetime, and I’m truly excited about the successful completion of this engagement and the clarity of guidance provided by the FDA as we move toward our next phase of development for SANA-013.”\nPlease refer to the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis dated November 29, 2021, available on the Company’s profile on\xa0www.sedar.com\xa0for additional information as to the Company’s drug development program and the steps required to be completed for the Company to be able to commence phase I clinical trials.\nAbout Wesana Health\nWesana\xa0Health\u202fhelps people transcend barriers in mental health and performance.\xa0We innovate in care development through our therapies and proprietary\xa0protocols, and in care delivery through activating a new multidisciplinary, technology-supported clinical model.

They deserve to have the best diagnostics and treatment options available to them, including a pharmaceutical option that doesn’t exasperate symptomology. We look forward to being able to move SANA-013 to a Phase I clinical trial as soon as possible.”\nWhile there are a number of available therapies to treat depression, the success rate of antidepressants is only approximately 30 to 40%, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic options3. Further, despite the established importance of treating depression, only 44% of TBI patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) received antidepressants or counseling4. Of those treated,\xa0there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of post-TBI depression5.\nWesana’s drug development program looks to utilize combination therapy to treat migraine and the symptoms associated with TBI, such as depression. By utilizing psilocybin and cannabidiol (“CBD”), a combination therapy of compounds with demonstrated effectiveness, SANA-013, is targeted to improve neuroplasticity and neurogenesis while acting as an anti-neuroinflammatory. In contrast to therapist assisted, single dose therapy, where a large dose of psilocybin is administered in clinic, which has exhibited poor durability and waning effects beginning as early as a few weeks post administration, SANA-013 utilizes a loading dose of psilocybin followed by self-administered maintenance doses of psilocybin and CBD to provide more sustained effects and benefit over time.\nMark A.

Wesana’s proprietary treatment protocol is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple mental health conditions including major depressive disorder associated with traumatic brain injury.\n“The positive results of this study align with my individual experience and the improvements that I observed in my personal journey with depression. It’s thrilling to see our scientific data support Wesana’s mission to find more effective treatments for the millions of individuals suffering from the symptoms of traumatic brain injury including depression,” said Daniel Carcillo, Wesana founder and Chief Executive Officer.\nDr. Mark Wingertzahn, Wesana’s Chief Scientific Officer, added “This is a great step forward in establishing the scientific evidence to support the utility of a combination product including psilocybin and cannabidiol in the treatment of depression and other unmet medical needs. Additionally, these data provide fundamental, independent scientific support for the ongoing drug development program for SANA-013.”\nPlease refer to the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis dated November 29, 2021, available on the Company’s profile on\xa0www.sedar.com\xa0for additional information as to the Company’s drug development program and the steps required to be completed for the Company to be able to commence phase I clinical trials.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors:\n“Daniel Carcillo”, Chief Executive Officer\nAbout Wesana Health.\nWesana\xa0Health\u202fhelps people transcend barriers in mental health and performance.\xa0We innovate in care development through our therapies and patent-pending\xa0protocols, and in care delivery through activating a new multidisciplinary, technology-supported clinical model.

The psychiatrist-led clinic will focus on serving the community through the delivery of personalized innovative psychiatric care, inclusive of ketamine therapy, medication management, psychotherapy, cognitive testing, and pharmacogenetic testing. It will also be the first clinic to offer Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Naperville, which has shown efficacy as a treatment for conditions such as Major Depression, OCD, anxious depression, and more.\n“Chicagoland is our core market, and we are thrilled to begin construction of our new clinic. Recently we surpassed a milestone of 4,000 administered ketamine treatments for major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction—a proof point of the importance of our offerings and the scale of need in our region,” said Dr. Nazeer. “As somebody with close ties to Naperville, including having grown up in the city, it is especially meaningful to me to bring advanced mental health treatments available today, to this wonderful community.”\nWesana Clinics (presently doing business as APS Ketamine) has a strong existing foothold in the area, operating a clinical network that includes two flagship mental health clinics strategically located in Oak Brook and Downtown Chicago. \xa0Since 2016, under the leadership of Wesana’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Abid Nazeer, the clinics have helped thousands of patients through integrated treatment and a comprehensive therapeutic approach\n“Meeting the ever-growing need for mental health care is central to Wesana’s mission,” said Meghna Agarwal Gaeta, Wesana Chief Marketing Officer. She added, “We are thrilled to take this step toward expanding our care delivery area to Naperville and surrounding towns.”\nThe Company has entered into a 10-year lease, with a rent-free period through August 1, 2022, which provides for fixed, annual rent escalations throughout its term. The build-out of the facility is expected to cost approximately USD $250.000.\nInvestor Relations Agreement\nThe Company also announces that it has entered into an investor relations agreement with Future Money Trends LLC and Affiliates (“FMT“), a limited liability company located in Austin, Texas. The agreement is for an initial term of sixty days, commencing on March 11th, 2022, at a cost of USD $500,000. FMT will provide financial publishing and digital marketing services to the Company.

{'Title': 'Wesana Health Announces New Findings Indicating Psilocybin Potentiates Impact of an Anti-Depressant', 'Description': '\n\n\n\n\n\nCHICAGO and TORONTO, March 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Wesana Health Holdings Inc.\xa0(“Wesana” or the “Company”) (CSE: WESA; OTCQB: WSNAF), a data-driven life sciences company focused on developing the novel therapies of tomorrow and delivering new care paradigms today, has announced data from an animal study, conducted by an independent global laboratory services provider in a validated model of depression.\nResults of the study showed that administration of imipramine given three weeks following a psilocybin loading dose provided an additional 39% further improvement in depressive behaviors from that of psilocybin loading dose alone. Furthermore, a second administration of imipramine given four weeks after a psilocybin loading dose provided an even greater reduction (45%) in depressive behaviors.\n“These results demonstrate that psilocybin has the ability to potentiate the effects of antidepressant medications,” said Mark Wingertzahn, Wesana Chief Scientific Officer. “These data could signal a shift in how we develop future clinical treatments for depression using both psilocybin and anti-depressants to optimize outcomes.”\nWhile there are a number of available therapies to treat depression, only 60%–70% of patients respond to antidepressant therapy. Of those who do not respond, 10%–30% exhibit treatment-resistant symptoms1, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic options. Further, despite the established importance of treating depression, only 44% of TBI patients with major depressive disorder received antidepressants or counseling2. Of those treated,\xa0there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of post-TBI depression3. These new findings suggest that combination therapy could provide more consistent and robust effects over time.\n“I’m proud of the work my team has done to continue investigating the full potential of psilocybin alone and in combination with other medications in order to one day provide tailored medication regimens that have an optimized benefit:risk profile,” added Daniel Carcillo, Wesana Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “I look forward to further investigations to address the massive need in our communities today.”\nAdditionally, The Company has entered into an engagement letter with MDM Worldwide for the provision of market awareness and investor relations services. The engagement has a six-month term at a rate of US$8,000 per month and upon completion, the issuance of 25,000 Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”).

In contrast to the prior development pathway for SANA-013 with TBI associated depression as the lead indication, the revised development pathway would allow the Company to bypass the healthy patient population study and research an MDD affected patient population directly as part of a Phase 1b/2a study.\nWesana’s SANA-013 is designed to deliver a novel depression treatment protocol that includes a single high dose of psilocybin followed by a maintenance regimen of a non-hallucinogenic dose of psilocybin combined with cannabidiol (CBD). The low, non-hallucinogenic dose of psilocybin in combination with CBD is being developed for MDD and other indications so that affected people can benefit from a chronic, at-home use proposition.\nDaniel Carcillo, Wesana’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Given the positive written feedback from FDA regarding SANA-013, we are extremely excited to begin developing meaningful clinical data for our novel formulation and protocol. We believe SANA-013 provides Wesana distinct advantages compared to other companies exploring psilocybin, as they are primarily focused on delivering large in-clinic doses of psilocybin on an intermittent basis and therefore are not optimally positioned to treat conditions such as MDD that likely will require some kind of chronic dosing.”\nMDD is a chronic, recurring, and debilitating mental disorder leading it to be one of the most burdensome illnesses on a global scale. Patients suffering from MDD are frequently and significantly impaired from an occupational and social function standpoint resulting in severe economic costs. With approximately 264 million people suffering from depression globally, according to World Health Organization data in 2020, the market size is currently estimated to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% to US$16 billion by 2026.1\nAbout Wesana Health\nWesana\xa0Health\xa0helps people transcend barriers in mental health and performance.\xa0We innovate in care development through our therapies and patent-pending\xa0protocols, and in care delivery through activating a new multidisciplinary, technology-supported clinical model.

Results of the study showed that administration of imipramine given three weeks following a psilocybin loading dose provided an additional 39% improvement in depressive behaviors from that of psilocybin loading dose alone.

Wesana intends to initiate its in-human clinical study program in late 2022.\nPositive Findings from Animal Study on Novel Depression Treatment Protocol Combining Psilocybin and Cannabidiol\nOn January 18, 2022, Wesana shared positive results of an animal study on a novel depression treatment protocol. Combining psilocybin and cannabidiol, the animal study, conducted by an independent global laboratory services provider, demonstrated considerable and sustained improvement in depressive behaviors.\nWesana’s novel and proprietary depression treatment protocol includes a single high dose of psilocybin followed by a maintenance regimen of a microdose of psilocybin combined with cannabidiol. In a validated pre-clinical animal model of depression, the maintenance regimen demonstrated up to 64% further improvement than those observed with a single high dose of psilocybin alone.\nFurthermore, the maintenance regimen provided a sustained antidepressant effect after the single high dose of psilocybin. Wesana’s proprietary treatment protocol is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple mental health conditions including major depressive disorder associated with traumatic brain injury.\nStrategic Rationale for Clinics and Other Care Delivery Asset Review:\nFeedback from the FDA validates the Company’s strategic plan for simplification and growth. Given the clarity provided by FDA in the pre-IND meeting, and the Company’s increased focus on drug development, Wesana has commenced a strategic review of the Company’s assets with a focus on reviewing Wesana’s care delivery division. The Company is reviewing strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, a sale of all the assets under the care delivery division, including:\n\nWesana Clinics\xa0– a network of psychiatrist-led mental health clinics focused on serving the community through the delivery of personalized innovative psychiatric care, inclusive of ketamine therapy, medication management, psychotherapy, cognitive testing, and pharmacogenetic testing.\nWesana Solutions\xa0– a medical-grade clinical SaaS platform focused on improving mental healthcare through facilitating access to leading edge clinical protocols and tracking their efficacy. In concert with EMRs and practice management systems, Wesana Solutions is intended to be used in clinics delivering psychedelics and related therapies, targeting the developing international psychiatric clinic and research market.\xa0\nPsyTech Connect\xa0– a leading community for the clinical use of psychedelics with over 8,000 actively engaged professionals.\n\nManagement Changes\nWesana today announced that, as part of a Board of Directors transition, Chad Bronstein has tendered his resignation as Executive Chairman, effective immediately, to pursue other professional opportunities. In connection with Mr. Bronstein’s resignation, the Company is pleased to announce the Company’s Board of Directors’ appointment of Daniel Carcillo as Chairman.\n“I am incredibly proud of the Company that we have built and the progress we have made to date,” commented Mr. Bronstein, “and I look forward to seeing the continued evolution of Wesana under Daniel’s leadership as the Company moves towards advancing its clinical development program and human clinical trials in the coming months later this year.”\nBronstein was instrumental in the founding of the Company as well as in its first years of growth. His commitment to Wesana over the past two years helped the Company go-public on the Canadian Securities Exchange and raise $17 million in capital, to initiate the FDA drug development and approval process.\n“On behalf of everyone at Wesana, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Chad for his support and guidance through Wesana’s early growth. Chad was a visionary leader who provided excellent stewardship as we navigated the going-public and related capital raise process. As we position ourselves for our next phase of growth, we will continue on the path Chad and I set to develop and deliver life-changing medicine to those in need,” said Daniel Carcillo, Wesana’s Founder and CEO.\nAbout Wesana Health\nWesana\xa0Health\u202fhelps people transcend barriers in mental health and performance.\xa0We innovate in care development through our therapies and patent-pending\xa0protocols, and in care delivery through activating a new multidisciplinary, technology-supported clinical model.
